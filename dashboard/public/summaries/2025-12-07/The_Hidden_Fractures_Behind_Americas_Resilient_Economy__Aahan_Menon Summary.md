## Executive Summary

This episode of Forward Guidance features Aahan Menon of Prometheus Macro discussing fundamental disconnects in the U.S. economy as of late 2025. While aggregate economic indicators appear strong—with nominal GDP growth between 4-5%—significant divergences exist beneath the surface. The conversation reveals three critical structural issues:

**Primary Thesis**: The economy exhibits surface-level resilience driven by AI capital expenditure and affluent consumer spending, but traditional macroeconomic relationships have broken down, creating challenges for both policymakers and traders.

**Key Arguments**:

1. **Consumption is wealth-driven, not income-driven**: Spending growth continues despite weak employment growth, indicating affluent consumers are drawing on balance sheets (wealth, capital gains, cash balances) rather than labor income.

2. **AI CapEx creates immediate profit juice with lagged costs**: Through the Kalecki-Levy equation framework, gross investment flows directly to corporate revenues while associated depreciation costs are recognized over years, creating a temporary but powerful profit boost.

3. **Monetary policy transmission has broken**: Post-COVID expansion of government balance sheets placed large amounts of Treasury securities on private sector balance sheets. When the Fed raised rates, interest income to Treasury holders offset interest expense burdens, inverting traditional monetary policy effects.

4. **Trading edge exists in short-term risk management, not long-term forecasting**: Even perfect knowledge of economic conditions 12 months forward would likely underperform passive strategies due to the mismatch between forecast horizons and trading horizons.

The discussion emphasizes that while aggregate numbers remain acceptable, increasing divergences between affluent and non-affluent consumers, between AI-related and traditional businesses, and between nominal and real growth create a complex environment where traditional recession playbooks may not apply.

## Detailed Analysis

### The Surface-Level Economic Picture

Menon characterizes the current economic state as "strong on the surface but uneasy beneath it." Coming into 2025, the economy showed strong nominal GDP growth and resilient consumer spending. Tariff announcements created market sentiment concerns with some impact on gross investment, but two factors sustained aggregate demand:

1. **Sustained AI capital expenditure**: A "really, really strong surge in AI CapEx" from technology companies
2. **Resilient consumer spending**: "A consumer that just doesn't give up in the United States"

Nominal spending growth registers between 4-5% depending on measurement frequency. However, Menon emphasizes that "increasingly more and more of the growth is just coming from affluent consumers who do most of the spending in the economy." Similarly, meaningful business investment concentrates almost entirely in AI CapEx, while "more classical old school economy type companies are not doing that type of investing."

The aggregate picture shows an expanding economy with cooling inflation as cyclical activity slows, but Menon notes: "I've never been someone who's like under the hood the economy is going to implode, like I'm not one of, that's not the camp I put myself in. But the divergences have started to get really, really big."

### Wealth-Driven Consumption vs. Income-Driven Spending

A critical structural shift involves the source of consumer spending. Traditional models assume consumption derives primarily from labor income, with the savings rate indicating sustainability. Menon argues this framework no longer applies:

"What we do know, like with a high degree of certainty, is that we do have a wealth distribution problem. And there is also an asset ownership distribution problem."

The mechanism works as follows: employment growth has weakened significantly, yet spending growth continues. Menon explains this requires one of three sources:

1. Increased leverage
2. Drawing down cash balances
3. Selling capital gains (converting to cash)

All three are "balance sheet concepts" rather than income statement items. This means "a lot of spending in excess of labor trend is coming from wealth, as opposed to income."

This distinction matters because wealth-driven spending can persist even as traditional labor market indicators deteriorate. Affluent households with substantial asset holdings, large cash balances, and capital gains can maintain consumption independent of employment trends. The savings rate becomes less meaningful as a sustainability indicator when spending derives from balance sheet liquidation rather than current income.

### Nominal vs. Real Growth: What Matters for Markets

Menon addresses a fundamental question for investors: should they focus on nominal or real growth? His answer: "What you focus on boils down to what you're trying to do."

**For recession forecasting**: Real growth and employment matter most. "If you're trying to forecast recessions or try to get an NBER dated recession, right? Don't worry about all this stuff. You can just look at the employment numbers. When it goes down, you got your recession, boom, done."

**For equity markets**: Nominal growth matters more because "the nominal growth dynamic basically flows straight to corporate revenues." The critical insight many investors missed over the past five years:

"That nominal growth just flows directly to profits unless there's a meaningful rise in wages. And so the rule of thumb, the real GDP growth is in sync with what's happening to the corporate profit cycle and the equity market cycle didn't work as well."

The mechanism: Nominal growth → Corporate revenues → Subtract wage costs → Residual becomes profits. When nominal growth increases but wages don't rise proportionally, corporate profits expand even if real growth remains weak. This explains why equity markets performed well despite concerns about real economic activity.

**For bond markets**: The trade-off between growth and inflation determines outcomes. "What matters for bonds is what is the tradeoff between growth and inflation, which is basically unemployment and measured inflation? And that's the world of bonds. That is 90% of all bond returns."

### The AI CapEx Phenomenon and Corporate Profits

Menon provides detailed analysis of AI capital expenditure's impact using the Kalecki-Levy equation framework. This macroeconomic identity uses GDP and GDI to solve for profit drivers, with spending items contributing to profits and costs (primarily wages) detracting.

**The unique property of investment spending**:

"The thing that's unique about not just AI CapEx, which is a type of investment, but all gross investment in GDP is that the associated cost with gross investment isn't recognized today. It's recognized in the future in the form of depreciation expense."

The timing mismatch creates powerful profit dynamics:

- When businesses invest, that spending immediately becomes someone else's revenue
- The revenue flows into aggregate profit calculations immediately
- The associated cost (depreciation) gets recorded on the GDI side as "capital consumption"
- Capital consumption "roughly, very roughly tracks long-term inflation"

**The mathematical result**: "If you have CapEx that goes up 20%, the associated cost is going to go up 2% and then 3% and then 4% over the next five years."

Menon's modeling reveals: "The most explanatory variable, the single most explanatory variable of corporate profits at any point in time, in terms of like total variation is gross investment in the U.S. economy net of capital consumption."

**Investment implications**: "While the CapEx is ongoing, that is business cycle stimulative. It is good for profits. Like don't get in front of that train." However, Menon emphasizes this cannot be sustainable long-term because:

1. AI CapEx must be financed (initially from free cash flow, now increasingly through debt)
2. "No economy can function purely on investing entirely"
3. Eventually requires "recomposition from investment to consumption spending"

Menon expresses skepticism about transformative productivity gains: "I'm a non-believer in like AI just being this absolutely transformative thing, which takes us to 6% real GDP growth a year." He questions how AI CapEx translates to broader consumption: "I don't see how like the tremendous amount of AI CapEx is going to lead to like more washing machines being purchased."

**Practical framework for investors**: Track whether AI companies continue CapEx spending in gross investment numbers. Don't worry excessively about depreciation schedules since capital consumption moves slowly with inflation. "The only thing you need to really focus on is are they still doing the capex and is that showing up in the gross investment numbers? If that's showing up in the gross investment numbers, don't fight that."

### Broken Monetary Policy Transmission

Menon identifies a fundamental breakdown in how monetary policy affects the economy, centered on net interest payments—"the net effective interest cost of the private sector."

**Historical relationship**: Previously, the Fed had "absolute control" over this metric. When the Fed raised rates, interest burdens for private sector enterprises rose proportionally, creating the intended tightening effect.

**Post-COVID structural change**: The massive expansion in government balance sheets resulted in "this inflow into private balance sheets of a very large amount of treasuries." The composition of private sector balance sheets shifted dramatically toward cash and short-term Treasury holdings.

**The inversion**: When the Fed raised rates, holders of short-term Treasuries "basically get that interest benefit immediately." Companies with large cash balances (particularly AI CapEx spenders) and relatively low debt experienced net interest income increases rather than burden increases.

Menon's modeling demonstrates: "We've actually seen is they hiked policy rates and net interest burdens went down." The traditional transmission mechanism inverted—rate hikes became stimulative for balance sheet-rich entities.

Additional factors compounding the breakdown:
- Fixed-rate mortgages locked in low rates
- Income rising for Treasury holders
- Wealth effects from asset appreciation

Menon quantifies the historical relationship: "It used to be near one for one...you do 500 basis points of easing that translates into like 500 basis points of net interest burden rise now it's like that's totally non-responsive."

**Implications**: "So long as you have this weird situation of like huge amount of private sector assets sorry public sector assets on private balance sheets it basically reduces the Fed's ability to be able to tighten very meaningfully." This structural change explains why aggressive rate hikes failed to slow the economy as expected and why the Fed struggled to achieve its inflation target despite employment weakening.

Menon concludes: "I don't think the actual spending and stuff like on the economy is that big a deal. But I think that this recomposition of balance sheets and breaking that monetary policy transmission mechanism is a really big deal."

### Liquidity Measurement and Trading

Menon distinguishes between liquidity as a useful conceptual framework versus specific liquidity measures as trading tools. His core position: "Frameworks are useful. Measures need to be evaluated."

**The liquidity concept**: "We want a rough measure of how much cash in this is that in the financial system that can potentiate spending in financial markets or in the real economy. That's a really great concept."

**Two primary sources in the modern economy**:
1. Reserves and the Fed's balance sheet
2. The repo market (now more important)

**The measurement problem**: Most commonly cited liquidity measures fail as trading tools. Menon notes they have charts showing "how like you would lose a lot of money if you try to trade directly based on the Fed's balance sheet or net liquidity or whatever people want to call it."

**Why balance sheet measures fail**: "Tracking the volumes of these aggregates is not good for trading markets. The volumes of these markets are balance sheet items, and they're going to be super lagged to the actual activity." As a general rule: "If you're trading and you're trying to do anything systematically, grabbing the levels of balance sheet numbers will lag everything else."

**The solution—market-based symptoms**: Instead of tracking slow-moving balance sheet aggregates, Menon advocates monitoring market-based indicators that reflect liquidity conditions in real-time:

- SOFR spreads
- Commercial paper spreads
- Implied volatility across assets
- Credit spreads
- Yield curve shape (kinks indicating stress)
- Equity factors (high leverage vs. low leverage, high beta vs. low beta)

The logic: "What you try to do is you try to search for the market-based indications of the health of these markets." These symptoms update daily and reflect actual market functioning rather than lagged accounting aggregates.

**Current liquidity environment**: Menon notes that while the Fed's balance sheet shows minimal change ("nothing ever happens"), repo markets show "tremendous amounts of growth." This represents "the handoff in the liquidity ecosystem from the public sector to the private sector." What matters now is "measuring whether there's a lot of borrowing and lending happening on private sector balance sheets."

### The Trading Horizon Problem

Menon addresses a fundamental mismatch between how macro is discussed and how it should be traded. His provocative claim: "Most big picture, like where the economy is going to be six months from now, 12 months from now, like all that type of stuff is actually like completely useless for trading markets."

**The evidence**: Menon references chart pack examples showing that even perfect foresight fails:
- "If you knew exactly what growth is going to be a year from now, you would probably underperform the S&P 500"
- "If you knew exactly what liquidity...is a year from now, you would underperform"
- "If you knew the exact price of the asset that you're trading one year from now, you would probably underperform"

**Why perfect foresight fails**: "Most edge lives in a very, very short-term space because it's highly competitive." Even with perfect annual forecasts, investors must adjust portfolios daily, weekly, or monthly. "There is typically a mismatch between macro commentary, so like your forecast horizon and your actual trading horizon."

The practical reality: "Your trading horizon is usually one day, one week, one month. And your forecast horizon is like a year. Those two things are completely uncorrelated."

**The real value of money management**: "Taking that view and reducing the risk around it dramatically." Unless an investor can "make a prediction, shut my eyes and I come back next year," the daily/weekly/monthly adjustments determine actual returns, not the annual view.

**Menon's business model reflects this belief**: "All of our big picture macro stuff is like 100% free at Prometheus now...It's called pay for portfolios, don't pay for content." His reasoning:

1. "Most people can't predict what's going to happen a year from now. Like I sure as hell can't."
2. "Even if you do perfectly predict these things, unless you're what I described where you like make a prediction, go and put on the trade, and then come back next year and let your prediction play out, you're probably not going to do very well doing it."

**What has monetary value**: "Being able to adjust your risk as you go through the cycle and as the odds change relative to your view that's where it has edge and that's what has monetary value."

**Practical advice for retail investors**: Menon recommends focusing on implementable, low-hanging fruit rather than attempting institutional-grade strategies:

1. **Diversification**: "Having actual diversification in your portfolios." Use leverage products to maintain return targets while diversifying: "S&P 500 plus another five assets, better risk-adjusted returns, all of the actual returns as well, outperform, don't take worse drawdowns."

2. **Volatility targeting**: "If you own an equity, typically if equity vol goes above 15%, it's a bad thing...just by reducing your exposure to make sure that you're not holding an asset above that 15% vol, it does really nice things for you."

3. **Basic trend following**: "A couple of moving averages put together does a good job at cutting off tails in markets." Menon emphasizes this requires minimal sophistication: "Basic trend following takes like less than five to make in an Excel spreadsheet. Don't let anyone charge you for that."

These simple techniques "are like readily available and can lead to dramatic outperformance relative to like owning the S&P 500 passively."

**Realistic expectations**: Menon cautions against seeking "something that just smashes the S&P, but like takes like a less than 10% drawdown. That is hard, okay? That is really hard." However, "just by having realistic expectations, doing some low-hanging fruit...all of those things are hugely value additive to any individual investor."

## Key Insights and Implications

### Structural Economic Insights

1. **The wealth inequality feedback loop**: Affluent consumers can sustain spending through balance sheet liquidation even as labor markets weaken, creating a bifurcated economy where aggregate indicators mask deteriorating conditions for non-asset-owning households.

2. **Investment-driven profit cycles differ from consumption-driven cycles**: The timing mismatch between investment revenue recognition and depreciation expense creates multi-year profit boosts that don't require sustainable end-demand, fundamentally altering business cycle dynamics.

3. **Balance sheet composition now dominates monetary policy effectiveness**: The traditional interest rate transmission mechanism has inverted for large segments of the economy, requiring new frameworks for understanding Fed policy impacts.

4. **Liquidity has shifted from public to private sector creation**: Repo markets and private sector balance sheet dynamics now matter more than Fed balance sheet changes for understanding financial conditions.

### Trading and Investment Implications

1. **Don't fight ongoing AI CapEx**: Regardless of long-term sustainability concerns, the profit juice from current investment spending creates a powerful tailwind for aggregate corporate earnings.

2. **Bond markets face structural uncertainty**: With employment weakening but inflation above target, and the Fed's transmission mechanism broken, bonds lack a clear directional catalyst. Menon's research shows short-term mean reversion strategies (betting on reversals) achieved 1.9 Sharpe ratios in this environment.

3. **Sector divergence creates opportunities**: While aggregate investment numbers remain strong from AI CapEx, traditional cyclical sectors (residential investment, non-residential construction, industrial equipment) are declining, creating relative value opportunities like "short energy...long tech."

4. **Forecast horizon and trading horizon must align**: Long-term macro views have minimal trading value unless an investor can commit capital for the full forecast period without adjustment.

5. **Simple portfolio techniques outperform complex forecasting**: Diversification with leverage, volatility targeting, and basic trend following provide more reliable value than attempting to predict economic conditions 6-12 months forward.

### Policy and Systemic Implications

1. **Traditional recession indicators may not trigger**: An economy can experience negative real consumption growth while maintaining positive nominal growth and corporate profit expansion, potentially avoiding NBER recession classification despite deteriorating conditions for many households.

2. **Fiscal impact operates through balance sheets, not spending flows**: Government spending's direct GDP contribution remains modest due to netting effects, but the accumulation of Treasury securities on private balance sheets has fundamentally altered monetary policy dynamics.

3. **The AI investment boom creates a temporary stability window**: Current CapEx levels provide business cycle support, but the eventual need to transition from investment to consumption spending poses a future challenge without clear resolution.

4. **Measurement challenges compound policy difficulties**: Slow-moving official statistics fail to capture real-time liquidity conditions, requiring market participants and policymakers to rely on market-based symptoms that update more frequently.

## Data and Figures

### Economic Growth Metrics

- **Nominal GDP growth**: 4-5% (varies by measurement frequency)
- **Real GDP growth**: Significantly lower than nominal, with divergence creating profit opportunities
- **Government spending contribution to GDP growth**: Approximately 0.3 percentage points (much smaller than gross spending suggests due to netting with tax receipts)

### AI CapEx Impact Quantification

- **Investment-to-profit transmission**: When CapEx increases 20%, associated depreciation costs rise only 2-4% annually over subsequent five years
- **Explanatory power**: Gross investment net of capital consumption is the single most explanatory variable for corporate profit variation across time periods
- **Capital consumption growth rate**: Tracks long-term inflation with a drag (approximately 2-3% annually)

### Monetary Policy Transmission Breakdown

- **Historical relationship**: Approximately 1:1 correlation between Fed rate changes and net interest burden changes (500 bps rate hike → 500 bps burden increase)
- **Current relationship**: "Totally non-responsive"—rate hikes led to net interest burden *decreases* due to balance sheet composition changes
- **Private sector Treasury holdings**: Substantial increase post-COVID, creating interest income that offsets interest expense

### Trading Strategy Performance

- **Short-term mean reversion in bonds (2025)**: Sharpe ratio of approximately 1.9
- **Interpretation**: High Sharpe ratio indicates persistent whipsaw behavior as markets struggle to price Fed policy path amid conflicting employment and inflation signals

### Volatility Thresholds

- **Equity volatility warning level**: 15%
- **Application**: Reducing exposure when volatility exceeds 15% historically improves risk-adjusted returns by avoiding periods when "bad things are happening"

## Definitions and Terminology

### Kalecki-Levy Equation
A macroeconomic identity that decomposes corporate profits into contributing factors by equating GDP (spending side) with GDI (income side). Revenue sources (consumption, investment, government spending, net exports) contribute to profits, while costs (primarily wages) detract. The equation reveals that investment spending creates immediate profit contributions while associated costs (depreciation) are recognized over future periods.

### Net Interest Payments
The net effective interest cost or income for the private sector, calculated as interest expense on debt minus interest income on assets. Historically controlled by Fed policy rates, but post-COVID balance sheet changes have broken this relationship for many entities.

### Capital Consumption
The depreciation expense component of GDI that represents the wearing out of capital stock. Calculated for the entire economy and tends to track long-term inflation rates rather than responding quickly to investment surges.

### Gross Investment
Total capital expenditure in the economy before subtracting depreciation. The key driver of short-term corporate profit dynamics according to the Kalecki-Levy framework.

### Nominal vs. Real Growth
- **Nominal growth**: Growth in current dollar terms, unadjusted for inflation
- **Real growth**: Growth adjusted for inflation, representing actual output changes
- **Trading relevance**: Nominal growth flows directly to corporate revenues; real growth better indicates sustainable economic activity

### SOFR Spreads
Secured Overnight Financing Rate spreads—a market-based indicator of liquidity conditions in short-term funding markets. Widening spreads indicate stress; tightening spreads indicate healthy liquidity.

### Volatility Targeting (Vol Targeting)
A portfolio management technique that adjusts position sizes to maintain constant portfolio volatility. When asset volatility rises, exposure is reduced; when volatility falls, exposure increases.

### Sharpe Ratio
A risk-adjusted return metric calculated as $\text{Sharpe Ratio} = \frac{\text{Return} - \text{Risk-Free Rate}}{\text{Standard Deviation}}$. Higher values indicate better risk-adjusted performance. A Sharpe ratio of 1.9 is exceptionally high for a trading strategy.

### QT (Quantitative Tightening)
The process by which the Federal Reserve reduces its balance sheet by allowing securities to mature without replacement, theoretically reducing liquidity in the financial system.

### Repo Market
The repurchase agreement market where financial institutions borrow and lend using securities as collateral. Now the primary venue for private sector liquidity creation, having overtaken Fed balance sheet operations in importance.

## Methodology

### Prometheus Macro's Analytical Framework

Menon describes a multi-timeframe approach to systematic macro trading:

1. **Big picture macro views**: Slowest-moving, focused on 6-12 month economic trajectory. These views inform overall positioning but "never change overnight."

2. **Medium-term positioning views**: Based on whether assets are cheap or expensive relative to economic conditions. "Can change really fast" based on market pricing.

3. **Short-term systematic strategies**: Intraday and weekly models that exploit market inefficiencies and liquidity conditions.

### Kalecki-Levy Profit Modeling

Menon's team models individual components of the Kalecki-Levy equation:
- Consumption spending and associated wage costs
- Investment spending and lagged capital consumption
- Government spending net of taxes
- Net exports

By modeling each component independently, they derive "now-cast" profit estimates that identify current profit drivers (investment vs. consumption) and cost pressures (wage growth).

### Liquidity Measurement Approach

Rather than relying on single balance sheet metrics, Prometheus constructs composite liquidity indicators by:

1. **Tracking source data**: Fed balance sheet, reserves, repo market volumes
2. **Monitoring market-based symptoms**: Spreads (SOFR, commercial paper, credit), implied volatility, yield curve shape, equity factor performance
3. **Combining slow-moving balance sheet data with fast-moving market indicators**: Creates tradable signals that update daily rather than monthly

### Net Interest Payment Modeling

Menon's team models the net interest burden by:
- Calculating gross interest expense across private sector debt
- Calculating interest income on private sector Treasury and cash holdings
- Tracking the composition of private sector balance sheets over time
- Comparing current transmission effectiveness to historical relationships

This modeling revealed the breakdown in traditional monetary policy transmission mechanisms.

### Backtesting Framework

The chart pack referenced includes backtests showing:
- Performance of perfect foresight strategies (knowing growth, liquidity, or prices 12 months forward)
- Comparison to passive S&P 500 exposure
- Demonstration that even perfect annual forecasts underperform due to path dependency and the need for interim adjustments
