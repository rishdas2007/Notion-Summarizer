## Executive Summary

This podcast episode features Max Levchin, co-founder and CEO of Affirm, discussing the Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) industry with hosts Joe Weisenthal and Tracy Alloway. Levchin, a member of the original "PayPal mafia," founded Affirm to address what he views as fundamental problems with traditional credit cards, particularly their misaligned incentives that profit from consumer late payments and compounding interest.

**Core Arguments:**

1. **Structural Misalignment**: Traditional credit cards create perverse incentives where lenders profit most when consumers struggle with payments through late fees and compounding interest
2. **Transparency as Competitive Advantage**: Affirm differentiates itself through complete transparency, no hidden fees, and fixed payment plans that never change
3. **Superior Underwriting**: Transaction-level underwriting using AI and alternative data sources enables better risk assessment than traditional credit scoring
4. **Industry Leadership in Reporting**: Affirm is the only major BNPL provider furnishing complete data to credit bureaus, helping consumers build credit history

**Key Objectives:**

- Explain Affirm's business model and how it differs from both traditional credit cards and other BNPL providers
- Demonstrate the company's commitment to consumer-aligned incentives
- Address concerns about BNPL transparency and consumer protection
- Discuss the broader implications for the payments industry and credit card rewards programs

## Detailed Analysis

### Affirm's Founding Story and Mission

Max Levchin's motivation for founding Affirm stems from two formative personal experiences with credit cards. At age 18, as a recent immigrant from the Soviet Union, he obtained his first credit card on a college campus without fully understanding the terms. He used it to finance his first startup, accumulated debt he couldn't afford, received collection calls, and eventually paid it off. However, five years later, after PayPal went public and he became "independently wealthy overnight" at age 23, he was declined for credit when attempting to purchase a luxury car (a black Mercedes convertible). This rejection, despite his newfound wealth, revealed that his earlier credit missteps had permanently damaged his credit score.

Levchin describes how friends would prank him at restaurants by having wait staff tell him his card was declined, causing him to "turn deep purple" well into his mid-thirties. This psychological impact drove him to question why the PayPal team hadn't addressed credit card problems earlier. In his late thirties, he discussed with a friend from high school, college, and PayPal how they had "built so much great AI at PayPal, fighting fraud" and could "do a better job scoring credit for young people" than existing systems. This conversation became the "seminal moment" that led to Affirm's founding a couple of years later.

### Business Model and Revenue Structure

Affirm offers two primary product types:

**Interest-Free Loans**: For purchases like a $100 shirt split into four payments of $25, the consumer pays no interest. The merchant absorbs the cost of the time value of money, effectively paying the consumer's interest. Affirm charges the merchant a fee that covers:
- Fixed costs of underwriting and servicing
- Probability of default
- Profit margin for Affirm

**Interest-Bearing Loans**: For longer-term purchases (24-36 months) or when merchants lack margin or interest in subsidizing consumer interest, consumers pay interest directly to Affirm. In these cases, Affirm shows both the principal and interest calculations upfront, displaying the complete payment schedule before the consumer commits.

Levchin emphasizes: "The value is fixed, so whoever is paying us almost doesn't matter." The merchant fee ranges from "less than credit cards" (which average 2.5-3% depending on merchant size) to "low single-digit percentage points when you are subsidizing consumer interest."

### Aligned Incentives and No Late Fees

Affirm's foundational principle addresses what Levchin identifies as the core problem with credit cards: "As you make the minimum payments or whatever the payments you're making, whatever you haven't paid off, the interest that you've accrued folds right into the principle and it compounds and compounds and compounds."

The company established two design principles from inception:

1. **Fixed Payment Plans**: Create plans that the lender commits never to change
2. **No Late Fees**: Never charge late fees of any kind

Levchin explains the logic: "If you agree to those design principles, you are not going to make more money if someone is late and you're not going to make more money if they take longer to pay you back. Obviously, you'll make less money because getting money to lend isn't free either."

This creates a fundamental reorientation: "I only want to lend money when I have a lot of conviction the person is going to pay me back on time. Because if they don't, I am just going to lose money." The result is that Affirm's delinquency rates are "about half the industry of credit cards," which Levchin presents as evidence that "we don't make nearly as many mistakes, or perhaps we are not willing to let people go late because we don't benefit from it."

### Underwriting and Risk Assessment

Affirm's underwriting process occurs at the transaction level, not just at account opening. When a consumer selects Affirm at checkout, the company:

1. **Requests Information**: For first-time users, Affirm collects basic information
2. **Accesses Credit Bureau Data**: Taps into standard credit bureau records if sufficient data exists
3. **Analyzes Cash Flow**: If credit bureau data is insufficient, requests access to bank account cash flow to understand the consumer's financial situation in real-time
4. **Renders Decision**: Makes an instant decision on approval and pricing based on current financial state

Regarding the use of alternative data points, Levchin notes that Affirm considers factors like the type of item being purchased (e.g., distinguishing between durable goods and consumables like vitamins that "may find yourself questioning the quality of the item long after it's disappeared"). However, he emphasizes that "vast, vast, vast majority of them, in fact, all of them actually, influence the decision we make by one or two percent at most."

He warns against "magic variables": "Anytime someone tells you, I found this magic variable, and if I just look at that, it's like 30 percent better underwriting or five percent better defaults, they're lying probably to themselves more than to you, but they're definitely lying." Instead, Affirm uses "lots and lots of subtle factors that are also compliant with all the various regulations, helping you shape a score that will tell you how likely this person is to pay you back."

### Merchant Relationships and Competitive Positioning

Merchants evaluate BNPL providers based on three primary factors:

**1. Fee Structure**: While important, Levchin acknowledges Affirm is not the cheapest option. He states: "There are definitely cheaper providers out there. There are plenty of brands that'll say, we're just like Affirm, but way less expensive for merchants. What that really means is that's because we charge all sorts of hidden fees."

**2. Approval Rates**: More critical than fees for many merchants because higher approval rates drive incremental sales. Levchin explains: "If your next marginal buyer is either a no thanks or it will cost you 5%, if you have the margin of better than 5%, you don't want the items staying on your shelves." Affirm's approval rates are "typically higher than the rest of the industry because we are so obsessed with underwriting."

**3. Brand Protection**: Merchants care whether the BNPL provider will harm their brand through aggressive collection practices or unexpected fees. As Levchin notes: "If the buy now, pay later provider is harassing the consumer for paying them back or has late fees or has unexpected fees, it's going to accrete negatively to the merchant's brand."

The competitive value proposition centers on consumer preference: "Consumers, as they cast their eye over the list of buttons, they say, well, the one I want to use is the one that's not going to get me if I stumble. And that makes for 24 million active users in the last 12 months."

### The Affirm Card Product

The Affirm Card represents an extension of the BNPL model into everyday transactions. Key features include:

**Dual-Mode Functionality**: The card switches between debit and credit modes based on user selection in the app. For small purchases like "a burrito," users employ debit mode, which "just literally takes the money from your account." For larger purchases like a TV, users can set up an installment loan in the app before the transaction, and "your card is ready. When you tap it next time, it becomes a loan automatically."

**Adoption and Growth**: Levchin describes the card as "super popular" and notes that "we went from we have this card idea to about 12% of our users having one very, very quickly because it's just a really, really good product." The company hasn't needed to advertise it extensively because existing users naturally adopt it.

**User Psychology**: The card appeals to consumers who have shifted their mindset "from revolving is okay, I don't understand it, but I don't care to I don't like revolving, I don't want to pay late fees, I don't want to pay excessive interest, this Affirm thing is neat. The card is a logical next step."

### Credit Bureau Reporting and Industry Standards

Affirm distinguishes itself as "the only one that furnishes, that's another fancy industry term, delivers the data of both positive and negative, as in you're on time, you're not on time, to the credit bureaus." This practice addresses several objectives:

**Building Consumer Credit**: Levchin emphasizes: "From the very beginning, we saw the idea of building credit history and improving credit scores for people who are on time as a key value proposition for our borrower. Like, we are not going to be the only lender for our consumers. They need to borrow for a car. They need to borrow for a house one day."

**Industry Standardization**: Affirm invested significant effort over a decade to work with credit bureaus and scoring companies to ensure BNPL data is properly interpreted: "It took a long time to persuade not just the credit bureaus, but also the companies that provide traditional credit scores to understand the data we furnish and treat it in the right way so that when you are on time, the scores go up, when you're not on time, the scores go down."

**Addressing Stacking Concerns**: Full reporting to credit bureaus enables better visibility into consumer debt levels across providers, addressing concerns about consumers "stacking" multiple BNPL loans. Levchin argues: "The right way to address this problem, and this is the right way, and it's traditionalist of me, but I really do believe it's the right way, is for everyone to report to the credit bureaus."

**Competitive Resistance**: When asked why other providers don't report, Levchin suggests: "If you're making a lot of money from late fees, it's a cool thing to tell your consumers, don't worry, you can just pay me off and it won't go on your permanent record. And if you don't make any money from late fees, you have no incentive to tell your consumers, oh, it's okay, just pay me something, and we won't tell on you. The connection between late fees and lack of reporting is unfortunately the underlying fact."

### Consumer Financial Health and Economic Outlook

As of the recording date (December 2, 2025), Levchin reports no signs of deteriorating consumer financial health: "Not as of December 2nd, 2025." However, he provides important context about Affirm's consumer base as an economic indicator:

**Selection Bias**: "Affirm is a great lens into the financial hearts and minds of North American consumer... It is a specific set of people. These people are more financially responsible. They made a conscious choice. They picked us not just because it's installment pay and yay, it's convenient. It's also because we told them we don't charge late fees."

**Leading Indicator Limitations**: Due to this selection bias, "it stands to reason that firm consumers will be probably much later into any kind of a macroeconomic earthquake territory if there was one to come."

**Current Assessment**: Despite these caveats, "as of right now, we feel quite good about our book and also about the US consumer."

**User Overlap**: Regarding potential over-extension across multiple BNPL providers, Levchin notes: "The user base overlap with other providers is quite minimal. So there's not a whole lot of stacking possibilities simply because people who use Affirm tend to stay with Affirm."

### Stablecoins and Cryptocurrency in Payments

When asked about a competitor's announcement regarding stablecoin integration, Levchin provides a measured assessment of cryptocurrency's role in payments:

**Cross-Border Commerce Rationale**: "If you have a lot of cross-border commerce, foreign exchange, the complexity of just diligence around, you know, everything from sanctions to reserve accounts, et cetera, you can squint a little and say, you know what, if we just lived in dollar-pegged stable coins everywhere all at once, it would be a little bit easier. And I think that's true."

**Limited Applicability**: However, "e-commerce is not a very significantly cross-border discipline... most people in the U.S. don't buy a lot of things from Zanzibar. They buy some things in other countries, but most of the time, because we all want things shipped to us very, very quickly, we're probably buying it from a U.S. subsidiary that's warehouses somewhere pretty close to the U.S."

**Future Considerations**: Levchin suggests that "in like five years, if you see me putting out a press release, it's not because I finally realized that I'm missing out. It's because there's enough cross-border commerce in our scale where it starts to make a difference."

**Rewards Skepticism**: On the idea of stablecoin-based rewards, Levchin expresses doubt: "I'm just not so convinced that they're going to be expanding their horizons to have more stable coins because ultimately they're just getting dollars."

**Value Proposition Priority**: "In the world of a firm, people that we serve every single day, 24 million of them in the last 12 months, they really, really care about the interest rates they pay... for them being told, hey, your reward is a 0% loan is incredibly powerful. And so before we get into using our hard earned revenue into stablecoins, we will just give it back to the consumers in a form of no interest."

### AI Implementation Across Operations

Affirm has deployed AI extensively across multiple business functions:

**Customer Service**: During high-volume periods like Cyber Weekend, "a huge percentage" of consumer contacts are "handled entirely by AI now." The AI handles basic queries like payment due dates, account status, and refund requests. Importantly, "that has not caused us to lay off our wonderful customer service staff at all. What it has allowed us to do is to go really deep into specialization." Human agents now focus on complex cases that require judgment or where "the possibility of hallucination" could damage customer relationships.

**Finance Department**: Surprisingly, "our finance group uses these tools obsessively" and is the largest consumer of AI tools internally, not the engineering group. Levchin notes that for a long time, finance employees were required to "know how to read code and probably write code," making them natural adopters of AI coding assistants.

**Legal and Compliance**: With "literally hundreds of thousands of very custom contracts" (every merchant interest subsidy requires a custom contract), AI helps "read and find errors and corrections." Additionally, as a regulated business, Affirm must ensure merchants advertise accurately. "AI tools are amazing at reading both loads of advertising copy and saying, hey, wait a second, that is inaccurate. We got to fire off an email and tell this merchant to fix it."

**Engineering**: While not the largest AI tool consumer, the engineering team extensively uses AI for code generation and other development tasks.

## Key Insights and Implications

### The Credit Card Rewards Paradox

A significant non-obvious implication emerges from the discussion: the potential instability of credit card rewards programs. Levchin identifies credit card rewards as "one of the less documented wealth transfers" where "people who never revolve, transactors, like probably both of you and me... we're paying our bills at the end of the month. We're not paying a penny of interest" receive rewards subsidized by "lots of people in America [who] revolve. Half the country revolves at $10,000."

If BNPL successfully attracts revolvers away from credit cards, the economics of rewards programs could deteriorate. As Joe Weisenthal observes: "If you could like cleave off that, then a big part of the business model of credit card, the legacy card companies, could potentially be unstable. And part of the appeal of going to any credit card that offers a lot of rewards could decline if revolvers move to this alternate payments model."

### The Late Fee and Reporting Connection

Levchin's suggestion that late fees and non-reporting to credit bureaus are connected reveals a potentially troubling industry dynamic. Companies charging late fees may avoid credit bureau reporting to maintain the appeal of "don't worry, you can just pay me off and it won't go on your permanent record." This creates information asymmetry that could enable consumer over-extension across multiple BNPL providers while simultaneously preventing consumers from building positive credit history.

### Transaction-Level Underwriting as Competitive Moat

The shift from account-level to transaction-level underwriting represents a fundamental innovation. Traditional credit cards approve consumers once and then allow them to use credit up to a limit. Affirm's model of underwriting each transaction individually enables more precise risk management but requires significantly more sophisticated technology infrastructure. This creates a potential competitive moat based on AI and machine learning capabilities rather than just capital access.

### The Specialization Dividend from AI

Rather than replacing workers, Affirm's AI implementation has enabled "specialization, specialization, specialization" where human employees handle increasingly complex, specific problems. This represents a practical example of AI augmentation rather than replacement, though it's worth noting this occurs within a growing company where transaction volume increases may mask any potential displacement effects.

### Merchant Incentive Alignment

The three-factor merchant evaluation framework (fees, approval rates, brand protection) reveals that the cheapest provider doesn't necessarily win. Merchants value incremental sales and brand protection enough to pay premium fees, suggesting that a "race to the bottom" on pricing may not characterize BNPL competition as it might in other payment sectors.

## Definitions and Terminology

**Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL)**: A payment method allowing consumers to split purchases into installment payments, typically interest-free for short terms, with the merchant often subsidizing the cost.

**Revolving Credit**: Credit that automatically renews as debts are paid off, allowing consumers to carry balances month-to-month while paying interest on the outstanding amount.

**Compounding Interest**: Interest calculated on both the initial principal and accumulated interest from previous periods, causing debt to grow exponentially if not paid down.

**Deferred Interest**: A promotional financing arrangement where interest accrues during a promotional period but is waived if the balance is paid in full by the end date; if not paid, all accrued interest is charged retroactively.

**Furnishing Data**: The practice of reporting consumer credit activity to credit bureaus, including payment history, outstanding balances, and account status.

**Transactors**: Credit card users who pay their full balance each billing cycle, avoiding interest charges.

**Revolvers**: Credit card users who carry balances month-to-month, paying interest on outstanding amounts.

**Interchange Fees**: Fees paid by merchants to card-issuing banks for processing card transactions, typically 2-3% of transaction value.

**Card Rails**: The infrastructure and networks (like Visa and Mastercard) that process card transactions between merchants, banks, and consumers.

**Underwriting**: The process of evaluating the creditworthiness of a borrower and determining whether to extend credit and at what terms.

**Stacking**: The practice of consumers taking out multiple loans from different BNPL providers simultaneously, potentially beyond their ability to repay.

**Approval Rate**: The percentage of credit applications that are approved by a lender.

**Late Fees**: Penalties charged when borrowers fail to make payments by the due date.

**Minimum Payment**: The smallest amount a credit card holder must pay each billing cycle to keep the account in good standing.

**Credit Score**: A numerical representation of creditworthiness based on credit history, typically ranging from 300-850.

**Stablecoins**: Cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value by pegging to a reserve asset, typically the US dollar.
