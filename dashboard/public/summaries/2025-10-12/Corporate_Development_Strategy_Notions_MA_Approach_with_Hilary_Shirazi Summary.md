## Executive Summary

Hilary Shirazi, Head of Corporate Development at Notion, presents a comprehensive framework for building and executing M&A strategy at high-growth technology companies. With over a decade of experience across LinkedIn, Pinterest, Zendesk, and Notion, Shirazi advocates for a buyer-led approach that emphasizes strategy-first thinking, early integration planning, and maintaining organizational agility.

**Core Arguments:**

1. **Deal Thesis Before Targets**: Acquisitions should begin with a no-names strategic document that crystallizes the problem to solve, rather than starting with identified companies
2. **The Four T's Framework**: Categorizing acquisitions as Talent, Tech, Traction, or Terrain deals determines appropriate diligence, integration, and success metrics
3. **Integration Embedded Throughout**: Corporate development should own integration rather than handing off to separate teams, maintaining continuity from deal thesis through execution
4. **Pre-LOI Alignment**: Vision alignment and roadmap planning should occur before the letter of intent to ensure strategic fit and streamline post-close integration

**Key Objectives:**

- Establish repeatable M&A processes that scale with company growth
- Minimize integration failures through early planning and stakeholder alignment
- Leverage technology (specifically Notion and AI) to maintain lean corporate development teams
- Build internal M&A capabilities progressively, starting with smaller talent and tech deals before advancing to traction and terrain acquisitions

## Detailed Analysis

### Career Evolution and Foundation Building

Hilary Shirazi's career trajectory illustrates the importance of learning M&A fundamentals within mature organizations before attempting to build processes from scratch. Beginning in investment banking, she transitioned to venture capital before discovering corporate development as a distinct career path in 2014.

**LinkedIn Foundation (2014-2018)**

Shirazi joined LinkedIn when the company had already completed approximately 20 acquisitions and established M&A best practices. This environment provided exposure to core principles:

- Quality over quantity in deal selection
- Strategy-led acquisition approach
- Integration embedded throughout the process
- Flexibility in execution
- Focus on value creation

The LinkedIn experience included being on the sell side when Microsoft acquired the company, providing perspective on both buyer and seller dynamics. At the time Shirazi joined, LinkedIn had approximately 3,000 employees, growing to 13,000-14,000 by her departure.

**Progression Through Scale**

Subsequent roles at Zendesk (public company transitioning to private), Pinterest (approaching $50 billion market cap but limited M&A experience), and Notion (private, approximately 1,000 employees) demonstrated that company size does not necessarily correlate with M&A maturity. Pinterest, despite its scale, had only completed small tech acquisitions of 3-4 person teams, requiring Shirazi to build new muscles for larger deals.

**Key Learning**: Starting at a company with established M&A best practices provides critical foundation before attempting to build processes independently. The principles learned at mature organizations can be adapted to different company contexts, but the fundamental framework remains consistent.

### The Deal Thesis Framework

The deal thesis represents Shirazi's core methodology for initiating acquisitions. This approach inverts the traditional process where companies identify targets first and then rationalize the acquisition.

**Components of the Deal Thesis Document:**

1. **Problem Definition**: What specific gap exists in the current roadmap?
2. **Timing Rationale**: Why is this acquisition necessary now rather than later?
3. **Priority Ranking**: Where does this sit relative to other strategic initiatives?
4. **Investment Scope**: What level of financial commitment is required? (This scopes the size of potential targets)
5. **Build Alternative**: What would the internal development path look like if acquisition is not pursued? (BATNA - Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement)
6. **Success Metrics**: Define success at 6-month, 12-month, and 24-month horizons
7. **Value Driver Identification**: Is the focus on talent, technology, or market reach?
8. **Template Examples**: Are there analogous acquisitions that can serve as models?

**The Deal Sponsor Concept**

A critical element of the deal thesis framework is identifying the correct internal owner, termed the "deal sponsor." Shirazi emphasizes that corporate development is not the sponsor—the sponsor must be the person who will own the acquisition post-close, typically someone in engineering, product, or design functions.

The deal sponsor selection follows a rule of thumb: the sponsor should be the person to whom the acquired company's CEO will report. For an engineering-led acquisition, this would be an engineering leader; for a product-focused deal, a product executive.

**Process Discipline**

The deal thesis must be created on a "no-names basis" to encourage first-principles thinking. When stakeholders approach with specific companies in mind, Shirazi coaches them to "back up" and articulate the strategic need without naming targets. This prevents "back-solving"—the tendency to rationalize a deal around a company that has captured attention rather than systematically evaluating the market.

**Example Application**: When a stakeholder requested acquisition of "a company in the video space," Shirazi used the deal thesis process to narrow the scope iteratively. By mapping the video company landscape and progressively refining criteria, the initial universe of 5,000 potential targets condensed to three companies that precisely matched the strategic need.

### The Four T's of M&A

Shirazi's "Four T's" framework provides a categorization system that determines appropriate diligence focus, integration approach, and success metrics for each acquisition type.

**1. Talent Acquisitions (Acquihires)**

- **Scope**: Smallest acquisition type, focused exclusively on bringing a team onboard
- **Product Treatment**: The acquired company's product is typically discontinued
- **Integration Focus**: Team members build new capabilities on the acquirer's platform
- **Scale**: Often teams of 2-5 people
- **Strategic Purpose**: Rapidly acquire specialized expertise or fill critical skill gaps

**2. Tech Acquisitions**

- **Scope**: Acquiring intellectual property or a product to accelerate time-to-market
- **Product Treatment**: Product is typically integrated into the acquirer's platform
- **Integration Focus**: Technical integration, rebranding, feature development
- **Monetization**: Generally treated as a product feature for retention rather than direct revenue generation
- **Example**: Notion's acquisition of Cron (rebranded as Notion Calendar)
  - Acquired with 3 employees
  - Kept product running independently for approximately one year
  - Rebranded and integrated into Notion platform
  - Team expanded significantly post-acquisition
  - Goal: Provide calendar functionality to complete the collaborative workspace vision

**3. Traction Acquisitions**

- **Scope**: Acquiring customers, revenue, or market presence that opens strategic adjacencies
- **Product Treatment**: Company often continues operating as standalone business
- **Integration Focus**: Sales integration, go-to-market strategy, revenue optimization
- **Monetization**: Direct revenue generation is expected
- **Timing Threshold**: Based on LinkedIn analysis (circa 2014), companies should reach or have line-of-sight to $1 billion in core ARR before pursuing traction deals
- **Examples**: 
  - Google acquiring YouTube
  - Facebook acquiring Instagram
  - LinkedIn acquiring Lynda.com (kept as standalone business with separate sales motion)

**4. Terrain Acquisitions**

- **Scope**: Long-term strategic bets (10+ year horizon)
- **Product Treatment**: Typically operates independently with significant autonomy
- **Integration Focus**: Minimal near-term integration; focus on long-term platform development
- **Company Maturity**: Only very large companies can execute terrain acquisitions
- **Example**: Facebook acquiring Oculus (betting on VR/metaverse future)

**Progressive Capability Building**

Shirazi recommends that companies build M&A capabilities progressively, starting with talent acquisitions, advancing to tech deals, then traction acquisitions, and finally (if scale permits) terrain acquisitions. Each category requires increasingly sophisticated diligence, integration capabilities, and organizational maturity.

### Pre-LOI Vision Alignment

One of Shirazi's most distinctive practices is front-loading vision alignment and integration planning before signing a letter of intent. This approach contradicts traditional M&A sequencing where detailed planning occurs post-LOI during confirmatory diligence.

**The Pre-LOI Process**

1. **Acquirer Vision Pitch**: Notion explains to target founders why they want to acquire the company and what they hope to build together
2. **Founder Roadmap Exercise**: Target founders are given several days to develop and present their 6-month and 12-month roadmap post-acquisition
3. **Alignment Assessment**: Both parties evaluate whether their visions align before proceeding to LOI

**Rationale for Early Alignment**

Shirazi notes that many founders in acquisition processes cannot articulate why the acquirer is interested in them. This represents a fundamental problem—if the target doesn't understand the strategic rationale, they cannot effectively evaluate fit or plan for integration.

The pre-LOI roadmap exercise serves multiple purposes:

- **Mutual Validation**: Ensures both parties share compatible visions
- **Integration Acceleration**: Creates a concrete plan that can be executed immediately post-close
- **Risk Mitigation**: Identifies misalignment before significant resources are committed
- **Founder Engagement**: Helps founders visualize their future at the acquiring company

**Framing the Exercise**

To avoid the perception of an onerous "homework assignment," Notion front-loads executive involvement. The CEO, technical co-founder, and head of product participate in early conversations, demonstrating genuine commitment. The roadmap exercise is framed as "setting yourself up for success" rather than "proving your value."

**Post-LOI Flexibility**

The pre-LOI roadmap establishes "goalposts" rather than rigid requirements. Shirazi emphasizes maintaining flexibility—the roadmap guides diligence priorities but can be adjusted as new information emerges. For example, if the target plans to pause their current product development to focus on integrated features, diligence on infrastructure migration becomes less critical.

**Diligence Prioritization**

The agreed-upon roadmap directly informs the diligence plan. Rather than conducting comprehensive diligence across all areas, the team focuses on aspects critical to the future vision. This approach reduces burden on the target company and accelerates the overall process.

### Integration Without IMO

Shirazi advocates for corporate development owning integration rather than handing off to a separate Integration Management Office (IMO). This approach maintains continuity and accountability from deal thesis through post-close execution.

**Rationale Against Separate IMO**

1. **Continuity of Understanding**: The team that developed the deal thesis and negotiated the transaction has the deepest understanding of strategic intent
2. **Accountability**: When the deal lead pivots to integration ownership, there is clear accountability for success
3. **Reduced Handoff Risk**: Integration failures often stem from plans that were incorrect initially or not properly understood during handoff
4. **Appropriate for Scale**: Companies executing 4-5 non-complex acquisitions annually can manage without dedicated IMO

**The Corporate Development Integration Model**

Under Shirazi's approach:

- **Deal Lead Continuity**: The corporate development professional who led the deal continues as integration owner
- **Tactical Involvement**: Integration includes unglamorous but critical tasks (e.g., equipment ordering, credential management, onboarding logistics)
- **Cross-Functional Coordination**: Corporate development acts as quarterback, coordinating functional experts rather than building a separate integration team
- **Early Planning**: Integration plans are developed before the term sheet, eliminating transition delays

**Hybrid Model for Larger Organizations**

At Pinterest, Shirazi hired a head of integration who reported to her but was embedded with deal teams from day one. This person:

- Attended all deal meetings alongside the deal lead
- Developed integration plans collaboratively
- Brought deep knowledge of internal company processes
- Facilitated seamless transition from "why we're doing the deal" to "how to execute successfully"

**When IMO Makes Sense**

Shirazi acknowledges that very large, complex traction or terrain acquisitions may require dedicated integration teams. However, even in these cases, maintaining close collaboration between deal and integration teams is critical.

**Minimizing Target Company Burden**

A key principle is limiting the number of internal stakeholders the target company must coordinate with. Shirazi recounts an example where a target company of fewer than 50 people faced 75 internal stakeholders from the acquirer across accounting, IT, workplace, and other functions. Corporate development serves as a filter, consolidating internal requests and ensuring only relevant questions reach the target.

**Example of Filtering**: When a benefits team requested detailed information about the target's gym membership plan to maintain benefit parity, corporate development intervened, recognizing that early-stage startups typically lack such benefits and the inquiry was not material to integration success.

**Integration Failure Modes**

Shirazi identifies common integration failure patterns:

1. **No Concrete Plan**: High-level, "hand-wavy" integration plans that lack specificity
2. **Missing Deal Sponsor**: No clear internal owner with authority and respect to champion the acquisition
3. **Sponsor Departure**: Deal sponsor leaves the company post-acquisition, creating ownership vacuum
4. **Strategy Shifts**: Post-acquisition changes in company strategy that invalidate the original thesis
5. **Operational Details**: Mundane but critical issues (e.g., AWS credential management, payment method transitions)

**Credential Management Example**: In one acquisition, the target company's site went down for three days because the person with AWS admin credentials was unreachable and the acquiring company couldn't update payment methods. This illustrates how unglamorous operational details can derail integration if not properly managed.

### Technology Stack and AI Integration

Notion's corporate development function uses Notion itself as the primary technology platform, consolidating functions that typically require 12+ separate software tools.

**Notion as Corporate Development Platform**

- **CRM Functionality**: Tracking companies, contacts, and relationship status
- **Deal Management**: Each target company has a dedicated page with all associated information
- **Template Library**: Pre-built templates for team structure, process documentation, thesis documents
- **Project Management**: Tracking diligence workstreams, integration tasks, and milestones
- **Collaboration**: Shared documents with target companies for roadmap planning and information exchange
- **Permission Management**: Controlling access to sensitive deal information

**Workflow Example**

1. Companies are tracked in a Notion database with status fields
2. Each company page contains meeting notes, strategic assessments, and relationship history
3. When a deal becomes active, templates are instantiated within the company page
4. All diligence materials, integration plans, and communications are centralized
5. Notion AI enables rapid information retrieval across all deal documentation

**AI Integration at Notion**

Notion's rapid AI adoption provides a case study in organizational agility. In November 2022, Notion's founders gained early access to GPT-3.5 during a company retreat in Cancun. They spent five days exploring AI applications for Notion, leading to:

- **Rapid Product Launch**: General availability of AI features by February 2023, making Notion one of the first at-scale SaaS companies to launch and monetize AI
- **Initial Market**: Individual users adopted AI features first, with enterprise adoption following
- **Product Expansion**: AI Writer, Database Autofill, cross-connector search, and AI agents
- **Strategic Positioning**: Building on top of models (OpenAI, Anthropic) rather than competing in foundational AI research

**AI in Corporate Development Operations**

Shirazi's team uses AI for:

1. **Competitive Intelligence**: Automated summarization of news and market developments
2. **Earnings Analysis**: Processing quarterly earnings reports from competitors and aspirational companies
3. **Information Retrieval**: Natural language queries across deal documentation (e.g., "What mobile companies have we talked to?")
4. **Team Efficiency**: Enabling a two-person corporate development team to accomplish work that traditionally requires larger teams

**AI Acquisition Strategy**

Notion's approach to AI acquisitions focuses on talent rather than expensive tech deals:

- **Acquihire Focus**: Recent acquisitions have been talent-focused in the AI space
- **Integration into AI Efforts**: All acquired founders have been assigned to Notion's AI product development
- **Founder Mindset**: Acquired founders bring scrappy, iterative approaches suited to rapidly evolving AI landscape
- **Brand Strengthening**: Successful AI product launches have strengthened Notion's brand as an AI-capable platform, making it more attractive to AI talent

**Market Timing**: Initially, AI startup valuations were prohibitively high and founders were uninterested in selling. As the market matured and many companies failed to achieve traction, acquisition opportunities emerged. Notion's demonstrated AI capabilities made it an attractive destination for founders wanting to build AI products for a large user base.

### Community Building in Corporate Development

Shirazi founded and maintains CorpDev Breakfast, a community initiative that has evolved from quarterly in-person gatherings to a global Slack community.

**Origin Story (2016)**

The community began serendipitously when Shirazi and a colleague independently brought friends from Uber's corporate development team to breakfast at LinkedIn. The groups merged, and the conversation revealed significant value in peer-to-peer knowledge sharing. The realization: "There's no community for CorpDev folks to share best practices."

**Evolution**

- **Quarterly Breakfasts**: Regular gatherings in the Bay Area for corporate development professionals
- **Organic Growth**: Expanded to approximately 50 attendees by early 2020
- **COVID Transition**: Shifted to Slack when in-person meetings became impossible
- **Current State**: Approximately 250 members globally

**Community Structure**

- **Membership Requirements**: Corporate development role in professional bio and work email address
- **Activities**: 
  - Posting questions and receiving peer advice
  - Job postings and candidate referrals
  - Sharing best practices and frameworks
  - Off-the-record discussions of challenges
- **Value Proposition**: Safe space for professionals at potentially competing companies to collaborate and support each other

**Community Philosophy**

Shirazi notes that "the universe of problems is actually at the end of the day, quite small." With sufficient people in the room, most challenges have been encountered before, enabling peer guidance and empathy.

## Key Insights and Implications

### Strategic Insights

1. **Front-Load the Deal Thesis Alignment**: By developing deal thesis before identifying targets and conducting vision alignment before LOI, Shirazi's approach inverts traditional M&A sequencing. This front-loading reduces risk and accelerates post-close execution but requires discipline to avoid premature target fixation.

2. **Scale-Appropriate M&A Capabilities**: The Four T's framework provides a roadmap for building M&A capabilities progressively. The $1 billion core ARR threshold for traction deals (based on LinkedIn's 2014 analysis) offers a concrete milestone, though this may require updating for current market conditions.

3. **Integration as Continuous Process**: Treating integration as embedded throughout the deal process rather than a post-close phase represents a fundamental reconceptualization. This approach challenges the traditional separation between deal execution and integration functions.

4. **Technology as Force Multiplier**: Notion's two-person corporate development team demonstrates how technology (particularly AI) can enable small teams to accomplish work traditionally requiring much larger organizations. This has implications for corporate development staffing models across the industry.

### Organizational Implications

1. **Deal Sponsor Criticality**: The emphasis on identifying the correct internal owner before pursuing acquisitions suggests that organizational readiness is as important as target identification. Companies lacking appropriate sponsors should not pursue acquisitions in those areas.

2. **Executive M&A Literacy**: Shirazi's emphasis on understanding each executive's M&A experience, fears, and biases highlights the importance of internal stakeholder management. Corporate development success depends on navigating internal politics as much as external negotiations.

3. **Founder-to-Founder Alignment**: The practice of involving acquiring company founders early in target conversations recognizes that cultural and vision alignment occurs at the founder level. This cannot be delegated entirely to corporate development professionals.

### Practical Implications

1. **Template-Driven Efficiency**: The deal thesis template and other standardized documents enable consistency and reduce cognitive load. Organizations can adopt similar frameworks to accelerate their M&A processes.

2. **Credential and Operational Management**: The AWS credential example illustrates how operational details can derail integration. Corporate development teams must maintain attention to unglamorous but critical administrative tasks.

3. **Community as Competitive Advantage**: The CorpDev Breakfast community demonstrates that peer networks provide significant value even among potential competitors. Organizations should encourage (within appropriate bounds) their corporate development professionals to participate in industry communities.

### Counterintuitive Findings

1. **Smaller Teams May Be More Effective**: The example of 75 internal stakeholders overwhelming a 50-person target company suggests that larger integration teams can be counterproductive. Lean, focused teams with clear ownership may achieve better outcomes.

2. **Pre-LOI Disclosure**: Conventional wisdom suggests minimizing disclosure before LOI to maintain negotiating leverage. Shirazi's approach of extensive pre-LOI vision alignment and roadmap planning contradicts this, suggesting that transparency and alignment create more value than information asymmetry.

3. **Corporate Development as Integration Owner**: The traditional separation between deal execution and integration functions is challenged by Shirazi's model. This suggests that the skills required for successful deal execution overlap significantly with integration management skills.

## Definitions and Terminology

**Acquihire**: Acquisition focused primarily on acquiring a team's talent rather than their product or technology. The acquired product is typically discontinued, and team members are redeployed to build new capabilities on the acquirer's platform.

**BATNA (Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement)**: In the M&A context, the internal development path the company would pursue if an acquisition is not completed. Used to evaluate the relative value of acquisition versus organic development.

**Core ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue)**: The recurring revenue from a company's primary business, excluding revenue from acquisitions or non-core products. Used as a metric for determining readiness for different acquisition types.

**Deal Sponsor**: The internal executive or leader who will own the acquired company post-close. Typically the person to whom the acquired company's CEO will report. Responsible for championing the acquisition internally and ensuring integration success.

**Deal Thesis**: A strategic document created before identifying specific acquisition targets that articulates the problem to solve, timing rationale, success metrics, and other key parameters. Created on a "no-names basis" to encourage first-principles thinking.

**Four T's**: Shirazi's framework for categorizing acquisitions: Talent (acquihires), Tech (IP/product acquisitions), Traction (customer/revenue acquisitions), and Terrain (long-term strategic bets).

**IMO (Integration Management Office)**: A dedicated team or function responsible for managing post-acquisition integration. Shirazi advocates for corporate development owning integration rather than handing off to a separate IMO for most deals.

**LOI (Letter of Intent)**: A non-binding (except for confidentiality and exclusivity provisions) document outlining the key terms of a proposed acquisition. Shirazi describes it as an "engagement ring" signaling serious commitment.

**No-Names Basis**: The practice of developing acquisition strategy and criteria without identifying specific target companies, enabling objective evaluation of strategic needs before market mapping.

**PRD (Product Requirements Document)**: A document used in product development to specify what will be built and why. Shirazi uses this as an analogy for the deal thesis—applying the same rigor to acquisition decisions as to build decisions.

**Term Sheet**: Similar to LOI; a document outlining proposed acquisition terms. In Shirazi's framework, integration planning should be substantially complete before the term sheet is signed.
