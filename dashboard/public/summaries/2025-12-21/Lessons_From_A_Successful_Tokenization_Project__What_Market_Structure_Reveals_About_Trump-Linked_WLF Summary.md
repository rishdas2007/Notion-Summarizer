## Executive Summary

This episode of Bits + Bips features two distinct segments examining blockchain tokenization and regulatory challenges. The primary segment features Mike Cagney, CEO of Figure Technology Solutions, discussing the company's successful implementation of blockchain technology for Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs). The secondary segment (introduced but not fully transcribed) involves Jason Brett analyzing how upcoming crypto market structure legislation could expose World Liberty Financial's centralization claims.

**Main Arguments:**

1. **Tokenization requires long-term commitment**: Most tokenization projects fail because they cannot sustain the initial friction and reduced profitability that blockchain introduces before reaching an inflection point of efficiency gains.

2. **Traditional finance institutions are leading blockchain innovation**: Major banks like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and JPMorgan Chase are now executing more innovative blockchain implementations than native crypto companies.

3. **DeFi's true value lies in direct capital connection**: The primary benefit of blockchain is connecting sources and uses of capital directly, reducing intermediation costs and improving efficiency.

4. **Regulatory clarity is essential**: Proper legislation distinguishing true decentralized finance from centralized actors claiming DeFi status is critical for industry credibility and growth.

**Key Outcomes:**

- Figure achieved over 100 basis points of cost efficiency through blockchain implementation
- The company reached profitability with $90 million net income on $160 million revenue in Q3, primarily due to blockchain efficiencies
- Figure has over 250 lending partners, including 10 of the top 20 mortgage companies
- The company ranks as the 11th largest crypto asset by total value locked (TVL) on CoinGecko

## Detailed Analysis

### Figure's HELOC Innovation and Blockchain Implementation

**Product Market Fit Discovery**

Figure identified a significant market gap in the mortgage industry: loans under $300,000 were unprofitable using traditional Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac processes due to fixed origination costs of approximately $13,000 per loan. For a $200,000 mortgage, this represents 6.5 percentage points—an unsustainable cost structure. Cagney explains: "Because of the efficiencies we captured through blockchain and the capital markets that we built out through blockchain cost us less than $1,000 to reduce that mortgage."

**HELOC as Mortgage Replacement**

Figure reimagined the HELOC product from an emergency credit line into a primary mortgage replacement. Traditional HELOCs served as backup funding sources, but Figure created a "fully dispersed laminated origination" where the entire credit line is disbursed at closing while maintaining the flexibility of an open-end mortgage. This approach combines the efficiency of unsecured personal loans with the lower rates of secured lending.

Cagney notes the credit signaling advantage: "If you had a borrower who could take an unsecured loan or put their home up as collateral and get a lower rate, whether they're going to pay the loan or not, which one they choose tells you a lot."

**Blockchain Architecture**

Figure uses Provenance, a public blockchain (not proprietary to Figure), ensuring immutability and transparency. The loan lifecycle operates entirely on-chain:

1. **Origination**: Credit, title, property, and income data are ingested directly into the blockchain
2. **Warehouse Pledging**: Loans are pledged to warehouse providers (like Goldman Sachs) using Dart, a registry service
3. **Aggregation**: Loans are pooled for sale to portfolio buyers or securitization
4. **Servicing**: All subsequent cash flows and remittance data remain on-chain

### Blockchain Efficiency and Cost Savings

**Rating Agency Cost Reduction**

The immutability of blockchain data fundamentally changed rating agency requirements. Post-2008 financial crisis, rating agencies required auditing every loan at $500 per loan to achieve AAA ratings due to concerns about document modification. Cagney explains: "Because of the way we ingest data into blockchain and the immutability of that, the rating agencies have lowered our requirements down to 20 to 30% of the loans and about $100 a loan." This translates to "a couple million dollars of savings per securitization transaction, per AAA-rated deal, which is about 50 basis points in terms of the cost of the lifecycle."

**Warehouse Pledging Efficiency**

Traditional warehouse lending involved sending spreadsheets to banks, receiving funds, and then spending five days reconciling whether the loans matched the documentation. Goldman Sachs's adoption of blockchain eliminated this reconciliation period, enabling faster funding, higher advance rates, and reduced operational costs.

**Three Value Propositions of Blockchain**

Cagney identifies three reasons Figure uses blockchain:

1. **Transactional efficiencies**: Over 100 basis points captured through reduced rating costs and warehouse pledging improvements
2. **Liquidity**: Created through ubiquity, homogeneity, real-time performance data, and market making
3. **DeFi integration**: Direct connection of capital sources and uses, eliminating intermediaries

### DeFi Integration and Capital Markets Evolution

**Progressive DeFi Adoption**

Figure systematically tested DeFi financing, starting with $10 million in loans financed cheaper than traditional warehouse facilities. After validating the model with additional $10 million and $100 million tranches, the company plans to migrate $1 billion to DeFi protocols.

**DeFi Platforms and Protocols**

Figure operates multiple DeFi platforms:

- **Democratize Prime**: An open but KYC'd DeFi platform
- **Hastra**: A protocol on Solana where users buy wrapped yields (Figure's yielding security), pledge them into Hastra, which applies capital to Figure's DeFi protocol. The staking tokens can be looped on Kamino or traded on Raydium.

**Global Capital Reducing U.S. Mortgage Rates**

Cagney highlights a significant benefit: "On Kamino, they prevent U.S. users from participating. So we have a bunch of non-U.S. capital that is participating and actually lowering the cost of mortgages to U.S. consumers coming through this DeFi construct."

**Liquidity Achievement**

Figure's loans trade with "hundreds of millions of dollars" in daily volume on CoinGecko, ranking as the 11th largest crypto asset by TVL. This liquidity emerged from creating homogeneous loan pools with common trading agreements and real-time performance visibility through on-chain remittance data.

### Stablecoin Strategy and Payment Infrastructure

**Yields Stablecoin Development**

Figure launched "Yields," a yield-bearing stablecoin registered with the SEC. The stablecoin has grown to "a couple hundred million in market cap" and serves multiple functions within Figure's ecosystem:

1. **Loan Funding**: Transitioning from fiat wire transfers to stablecoin disbursement
2. **Warehouse Pledging**: Goldman Sachs and other warehouse providers send Yields instead of dollar wires
3. **Loan Sales**: Portfolio buyers like Apollo send Yields for loan purchases
4. **Securitization Settlement**: Planned for 2026, enabling synchronous security and payment settlement

**Yields Design Features**

- Convertible to USDC 24/7, maintaining liquidity
- Pays interest, unlike traditional stablecoins
- Can hold treasuries or bank deposits, keeping liabilities on bank balance sheets
- Provides benefits unavailable from traditional stablecoins

**Banking Industry Transformation**

Cagney predicts significant disruption from the GENIUS Act stablecoin legislation. JPMorgan Chase recently moved JPCoin from a proprietary forked Ethereum blockchain to Base (an Ethereum L2), signaling intent to build a new payment rail. Cagney anticipates JPMorgan will eliminate interchange fees by connecting issuing and merchant banks directly: "Why do we need the issuing processor, Visa, and the merchant acquirer? Why don't we just have an issuing bank us and a merchant bank us, and we trade on our rail."

This poses an existential threat to regional banks: "If I'm a regional or super regional bank, this should be an absolutely terrifying idea to me because they're going to come out to my liabilities and they're going to get it because they're going to be able to offer stable coin value that I can't do."

### Regulatory Advocacy and Market Structure

**Three Legislative Priorities**

Figure advocates for three regulatory changes:

1. **Non-Security Settlement**: Ability to settle non-security transactions with Yields (a registered security) outside traditional Alternative Trading Systems (ATS) or national market exchanges
2. **Transfer Agent Modernization**: Accepting wallet addresses as sufficient for shareholder communication instead of requiring email addresses
3. **DeFi Protection**: Codifying peer-to-peer transactions as outside securities regulation when truly decentralized

**Congressional Education Efforts**

Cagney provides tangible use cases to senators demonstrating DeFi benefits to constituents. For example, he showed Senator Warnock (D-Georgia) that Figure funded over $1 billion in Georgia loans with rates reduced through DeFi participation. This concrete evidence helps legislators understand DeFi's practical value beyond abstract concepts.

**Regulatory Uncertainty**

While the SEC under current leadership has taken positions protecting certain DeFi structures, Cagney emphasizes: "That's the position, right? That's not the law. And so what we need to do is get legislation codified for that protection so such that we don't lose it in the case that Chairman Atkins leaves and someone else comes in with a different view."

### Defining True Decentralization

**Litmus Tests for DeFi**

Cagney provides clear criteria distinguishing genuine DeFi from "DeFi theater":

1. **No Intermediation**: "If at any point you are touching the transaction between party A and party B, that's not a decentralized transaction"
2. **Community Governance**: The community must vote for and control smart contracts, not a single entity with exclusive governance rights
3. **Economic Participation Allowed**: Smart contracts can allocate fees to creators, but the community must be able to modify these arrangements

**Decentralization vs. Anonymity**

Cagney challenges the conflation of decentralization with anonymity: "I don't view those things as the same, right? So decentralization is there isn't a single point that is intermediating transactions or driving the structure or terms of the transactions. It's a community quorum that effectively does that." 

A smart contract can require KYC certificates in wallets while remaining decentralized if governance is distributed. "The community could vote to not require that... But I don't think that decentralization and anonymity are the same thing."

**Figure's Governance Structure**

Figure initially held the majority of Provenance's Hash tokens but distributed or burned tokens to reduce its holding to 20%. The company plans to reduce this further to 10% or below through burning functions tied to ecosystem activity, ensuring Figure cannot influence quorum decisions.

### Future Vision: Distributed Applications vs. Super Apps

**Philosophical Divergence from SoFi**

Cagney contrasts his current approach with SoFi's super app strategy (also pursued by Robinhood and Coinbase). Rather than centralizing all financial services within one platform, he envisions: "Self-custody wallets and distributed applications. And I think you and I will carry all the relevant information we need, whether it's our assets, reliability, identity or KYC, what have you in our wallet. And we will choose what venue we trade equity on, what venue we trade crypto on, what venue we borrow against assets, what venue we lend against assets as distributed apps."

**Wallet-Centric Financial Services**

This model requires improved wallet experiences—currently "very intimidating," "non-intuitive," and "cumbersome." The vision involves users connecting wallets directly to decentralized exchanges (DEXs) trading securities through Alternative Trading Systems, eliminating introducing brokers like Robinhood or Schwab.

**Figure's Equity Offering as Precedent**

Figure filed an S1 for a "second IPO" (actually secondary offering) with Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley as underwriters, planning blockchain-native issuance in January 2026. This offering will:

- Eliminate DTCC (Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation)
- Eliminate NASDAQ as intermediary
- Replace prime brokerage with DeFi
- Allow direct market access via wallet connections

Cagney views this as "a wholesale replacement of an equity capital market piece" and expects other companies to follow this precedent.

### Tokenization Challenges and Long-Term Vision

**Why Most Tokenization Projects Fail**

Cagney argues that most real-world asset (RWA) tokenization projects remain insignificant. Examples:

- **Biddle**: $3.5 billion AUM in a money market fund context where profitability requires ~$100 billion
- **Apollo's aCred**: "A couple hundred million dollars... doesn't even begin to move a needle for Apollo"

**The Initial Friction Problem**

Blockchain initially creates friction rather than reducing it. Cagney recounts: "In the beginning, the hedge funds that came to us to start buying loans said, hey, I'll pay you more if I don't have to deal with blockchain. Literally, they would have paid me more money per loan if they didn't have to deal with the blockchain."

Insurance companies similarly offered higher prices for non-blockchain underwriting that would have destroyed the homogeneity necessary for liquidity. Figure consistently refused these offers, accepting lower profitability to maintain its blockchain strategy.

**The Inflection Point**

Cagney emphasizes: "There isn't this panacea of money on blockchain that you can't get to anywhere else. Money is really smart and can get to whatever it wants to. It doesn't need the blockchain to do that." 

Figure reached its inflection point 1.5-2 years ago, where blockchain became an asset rather than liability. The Q3 results demonstrate this: $90 million net income on $160 million revenue represents a 56% net margin, "because of blockchain efficiencies that weren't there three years before."

**Long-Term Commitment Requirement**

The fundamental challenge: "There aren't a lot of projects that can lean in and commit to leave those dollars on the table up front over the course of two, three, four years to get to that inflection point."

**Traditional Finance Leading Innovation**

Cagney observes that major banks now execute more innovative blockchain work than native crypto companies: "The sell side in particular, the big banks, the Goldman's, the Morgan Stanley's, and certainly the JP's, they are moving into blockchain and doing, in my mind, much more innovative and disruptive work right now than the Coinbase's of the world are."

He compares the current moment to fintech's evolution: "When I started SoFi, I went to the very first LendIt and it was like the bar scene out of Star Wars, right? It was the weirdest group of people that you ever see... And two years later, it was just all suits. And so I think we're at the all suits inflection point that's about to happen in blockchain."

## Key Insights and Implications

### Non-Obvious Conclusions

1. **Blockchain as Initial Liability**: Contrary to common assumptions, blockchain initially reduces profitability and creates friction. Success requires willingness to accept lower returns for 2-4 years before efficiency gains materialize.

2. **Liquidity Requires More Than Tokenization**: Simply placing assets on blockchain does not create liquidity. Liquidity requires ubiquity, homogeneity, market making, real-time performance data, and common trading agreements.

3. **DeFi's Killer App is Traditional Finance**: The most compelling DeFi use case is not crypto-native assets but traditional financial products like mortgages, where DeFi can demonstrably reduce consumer costs through disintermediation.

4. **Decentralization and Anonymity are Orthogonal**: True DeFi can require KYC/AML compliance while maintaining decentralized governance. The conflation of these concepts creates unnecessary regulatory friction.

5. **Traditional Banks as Blockchain Innovators**: Major financial institutions are now leading blockchain innovation, potentially outpacing native crypto companies in practical implementation and disruption.

6. **Stablecoin Utility Drives Adoption**: Stablecoins have limited proliferation because they lack utility in everyday transactions. Regulatory changes enabling payment rail functionality will be transformative.

7. **Distributed Apps vs. Super Apps**: The future may favor wallet-centric distributed applications over centralized super apps, fundamentally changing customer relationships and platform economics.

### Industry Implications

**For Tokenization Projects**: Success requires multi-year commitment to blockchain despite initial profitability reduction, focus on liquid asset classes, and creation of homogeneous pools with real-time performance data.

**For Traditional Finance**: Banks face existential threats from competitors building blockchain-native payment rails. Regional banks are particularly vulnerable to deposit migration toward yield-bearing stablecoins and more efficient payment systems.

**For DeFi Protocols**: Regulatory clarity distinguishing true decentralization from centralized actors is essential for legitimacy and growth. Projects must demonstrate genuine community governance and lack of intermediation.

**For Regulators**: Concrete use cases showing constituent benefits (e.g., lower mortgage rates) are more persuasive than abstract arguments about innovation. Legislation must distinguish decentralization from anonymity.

**For Crypto Companies**: Traditional financial institutions may capture blockchain's value creation if native crypto companies fail to move beyond speculation toward practical financial services implementation.

## Definitions and Terminology

**HELOC (Home Equity Line of Credit)**: An open-end mortgage secured by home equity, allowing borrowers to draw, repay, and redraw funds up to a credit limit. Figure's innovation uses HELOCs as primary mortgages rather than secondary credit lines.

**Tokenization**: The process of representing real-world assets (like mortgages) as digital tokens on a blockchain, enabling programmable ownership, transfer, and settlement.

**DeFi (Decentralized Finance)**: Financial services operating through smart contracts on blockchain without centralized intermediaries. True DeFi requires community governance and no single point of intermediation.

**Provenance**: A public blockchain (not proprietary to Figure) used for loan origination, servicing, and trading. Provides immutability and transparency for mortgage data.

**Dart**: Figure's registry service for encumbering loans pledged to warehouse providers, enabling real-time verification of loan ownership and reducing reconciliation time.

**Warehouse Pledging**: Short-term financing where lenders pledge originated loans as collateral to banks (warehouse providers) before selling loans to permanent investors.

**Securitization**: Pooling loans and issuing bonds backed by the loan cash flows, typically with credit enhancement to achieve investment-grade ratings.

**Yields**: Figure's yield-bearing stablecoin registered with the SEC, convertible to USDC 24/7, used for loan funding, sales, and settlement within Figure's ecosystem.

**GENIUS Act**: Proposed stablecoin legislation expected to enable stablecoins as payment rails, potentially disrupting traditional banking deposits and payment systems.

**Hash**: The utility token of Provenance blockchain, used for governance voting. Figure reduced its holdings to ensure community control.

**Alternative Trading System (ATS)**: SEC-regulated venue for trading securities outside traditional exchanges, subject to less stringent requirements than national exchanges.

**DTCC (Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation)**: Traditional infrastructure for securities settlement and custody that blockchain-native issuance can eliminate.

**Hastra**: Figure's DeFi protocol on Solana where users stake wrapped yields to generate returns, with tokens tradable on Raydium or loopable on Kamino.

**Democratize Prime**: Figure's open but KYC'd DeFi platform for lending and borrowing.

**Super App**: A centralized platform offering multiple financial services (lending, banking, brokerage, wealth management) with cross-selling as the primary value proposition. Examples include SoFi, Robinhood, and Coinbase's strategies.

**Distributed Applications (DApps)**: Decentralized applications that users access via self-custody wallets, choosing different venues for different financial services rather than using a single centralized platform.
