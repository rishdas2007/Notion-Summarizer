## Executive Summary

This podcast episode features Andrew Ross Sorkin discussing his book *1929: Inside the Greatest Crash in Wall Street History—and How It Shattered a Nation*. The conversation explores the 1929 stock market crash through detailed archival research, revealing how retail speculation, excessive leverage, and inadequate regulatory frameworks combined to create one of history's most devastating financial crises.

**Main Arguments:**
- The 1929 crash resulted from excessive leverage in the system, with retail investors able to borrow $10 for every $1 invested
- The crash itself was merely the first domino; subsequent policy failures (tariffs, Fed inaction, Treasury's punitive stance) created the Great Depression
- Modern parallels exist in AI speculation, democratization of complex financial products, and potential removal of regulatory guardrails
- Every financial crisis fundamentally stems from excessive leverage, regardless of other contributing factors

**Key Historical Insights:**
- Charles Mitchell of National City Bank (later Citigroup) pioneered consumer credit for stock purchases
- John Raskob, comparable to Elon Musk in influence, advocated for the five-day work week and built the Empire State Building
- RCA (ticker: RADIO) served as the era's speculative technology stock, reaching $530 (split-adjusted) before falling to $3 by 1932
- The crash created generational trauma that kept many Americans out of the stock market for decades

## Detailed Analysis

### Book Genesis and Research Methodology

Sorkin's decade-long research project faced significant challenges due to the absence of living witnesses and scattered archival materials. Unlike his previous work *Too Big to Fail*, which relied heavily on interviews, this project required excavating "letters and notes and memos and transcripts" from disparate sources. Archivists initially warned him that achieving the "granular detail" characteristic of his earlier work would be "too hard to find."

A breakthrough came when Sorkin obtained previously unavailable minutes from New York Federal Reserve board meetings, which "really actually sort of grounded the project." This access provided unprecedented insight into the deliberations and decision-making processes of key financial leaders during the crisis period.

Sorkin explicitly avoided drawing contemporary parallels while writing, stating: "When I started writing this book, I never even thought about today. I was thinking really about then." However, he acknowledged that as the manuscript neared completion approximately two years ago, modern parallels became increasingly apparent, particularly regarding debates about interest rates and speculation.

### Key Historical Figures

**Charles Mitchell** emerged as a central, complex figure—simultaneously villain and innovator. As head of National City Bank (predecessor to Citigroup), Mitchell "effectively invented sort of modern credit for lending, if you will, to individuals to go and buy stock." His influence was such that Senator Carter Glass coined the term "Mitchellism" to describe the dangerous proliferation of debt and leverage in the financial system. Mitchell's fame in the 1920s would have rivaled "a Jamie Dimon of today" or "the Michael Milken of his time."

**John Raskob** represented the era's entrepreneurial spirit and technological optimism. Sorkin characterizes him as "like Elon Musk in the 1920s"—omnipresent, philosophically ambitious, and involved in multiple transformative ventures. Raskob:
- Helped run General Motors and pioneered consumer credit for automobile purchases
- Advocated for the five-day work week as an economic stimulus (people would "go spend money. They'll buy cars")
- Engaged in political activities aimed at undermining President Hoover
- Oversaw construction of the Empire State Building, "the equivalent of a spaceship" for that era

**Carter Glass**, senator from Virginia and co-author of Glass-Steagall, served as "the Elizabeth Warren of his time." Glass helped create the legislation establishing the Federal Reserve and spent years warning about the dangers of excessive leverage, specifically targeting Mitchell's lending practices.

**Jesse Livermore**, the legendary short seller, exemplifies the era's boom-bust psychology. After near-bankruptcy in 1927-1928 as markets continued rising, Livermore successfully shorted the 1929 crash, making "something like a hundred million dollars plus." However, he "ultimately loses it" and later died by suicide in 1941 at the Sherry Netherlands hotel.

### Retail Leverage and Market Infrastructure in 1929

The democratization of stock market participation represented a fundamental shift in American finance. Sorkin describes how "brokerages were springing up on the corners of streets the way they're like Starbucks" in New York. These establishments offered extraordinary leverage: "you would show up and you could give them a dollar and they would literally lend you 10."

Physical infrastructure included:
- Hotel lounges with stock tickers, including women-only trading rooms
- Brokerage offices on cruise ships
- Street-corner trading houses throughout major cities

The margin lending ratio of 10:1 meant that "when the market was going up, it really was like free money." This represented "the first time this was ever really happening," creating a situation where "people didn't fully appreciate all the things that were possible."

Investment trusts—precursors to mutual funds—created "Russian dolls of leverage," with layered structures that obscured underlying risks. These vehicles lacked transparency, and investors often had no clear understanding of their holdings.

### Technology and Information Asymmetry

The 1929 market operated with severe information delays that exacerbated volatility. The New York Stock Exchange's "big board" displaying prices "would often fall behind literally by hours." Sorkin emphasizes: "you could be looking at the board thinking that you know what the score is, if you will, what the prices of the stock is. But it would literally be hours off."

This information lag created cascading problems:
- Floor traders called brokerage houses to relay prices, but "their numbers were hopelessly out of date"
- Investors trading on ships faced delays of "half a day, a day"
- The famous photographs of crowds on Wall Street in October 1929 show people who "had gone down there physically because they wanted to see what was actually happening to their investments because you couldn't call somebody. There was no app to look at"

Disclosure requirements were virtually nonexistent. Companies distributed "leaflets" rather than prospectuses, if they provided any documentation at all. This was "pre the creation of the SEC," meaning "the kind of rules and regulations and just disclosures just didn't exist in the same way that they do today." Investors lacked access to basic financial metrics like P/E ratios.

### The Role of RCA as the "NVIDIA of 1929"

Radio Corporation of America (RCA, ticker symbol: RADIO) embodied the era's technological optimism and speculative excess. The company held "not only had the technology for radio, they had the patents for television," making it "the meme stock of that era because people were buying into this future that we were all going to experience."

The parallel to contemporary AI speculation is striking. Just as current discussions frame AI's market opportunity as "basically uncapped. It's the entire world. It's like all of business," 1920s investors believed "the entire world was buying into the US" through companies like RCA.

RCA's stock trajectory illustrates the severity of the crash: reaching approximately $530 (split-adjusted) at its peak, the stock collapsed to "like three dollars" by 1932. Critically, Sorkin notes that financial information about RCA remains scarce: "we don't know their P.E. ratio" or detailed operational metrics, making it difficult to assess whether the company was genuinely profitable or primarily valued on future expectations.

### Federal Reserve's Response and Institutional Limitations

The Federal Reserve's ineffectiveness stemmed from both institutional immaturity and political constraints. Founded in 1913, the Fed was only 16 years old during the 1929 crisis. Sorkin argues that policymakers "were cognizant of the political pressures" and feared that aggressive action might threaten the institution's existence: "They knew there was speculation. But if they had said, OK, we're going to really just raise interest rates...I think they actually feared that maybe there wouldn't be a Fed."

The Fed's primary tool for addressing speculation was the margin lending rate, but "they didn't really use it." Instead, officials pursued "moral suasion," sending "letters to banks saying, please stop lending to speculators." This approach created confusion, as bankers responded: "what are you talking about? How are you defined what a speculator is? What isn't one?"

The inconsistent response had perverse effects: "Some of the banks were so scared that they effectively stopped lending. That unto itself was a problem." Meanwhile, figures like Charles Mitchell publicly advocated for lower interest rates, creating a cacophony of conflicting signals.

The 1907 financial panic, resolved by J.P. Morgan personally organizing a banker consortium, created dangerous overconfidence. This experience "led to a sort of sense of overconfidence...that if you could just put the right people in a room together, we could solve anything." Thomas Lamont, effectively running J.P. Morgan during 1929, embodied this belief, but "1929 and what happened in the markets just got so far away from them that they realized that there was nothing ultimately in the end they could do."

### The Crash and Its Aftermath

Sorkin emphasizes that "the crash really happened over several days. It was not just one bad day." During this period, astrologer Evangeline Adams—who maintained an office in Carnegie Hall and held court at the Plaza Hotel—conducted group sessions that "were almost like seances" where people sought supernatural intervention for "higher stock prices."

The crash itself was merely "the first domino of a series of things that were sort of the necessary ingredients to create the depression." Subsequent policy failures included:

1. **Smoot-Hawley Tariffs**: Protectionist trade policies that contracted international commerce
2. **Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon's Punitive Stance**: Mellon advocated "let these capitalists eat it. They were speculating, let them suffer"
3. **Federal Reserve Inaction**: The Fed "really did very little at the time and almost sat on their hands"
4. **Gold Standard Constraints**: Monetary policy rigidity prevented flexible responses
5. **Banking Collapse**: "9000 banks going out of business"

The human cost was staggering: unemployment reached 25%, and "shanty towns, otherwise known as Hoovervilles," appeared "literally in Central Park, just a couple of blocks from here."

The psychological impact created generational trauma. Sorkin shares a personal anecdote: his grandfather, age 11 in 1929, witnessed someone jump from a window during the crash. "He lived till he was 91 years old. And he never bought a share of stock in his entire life...And he would always say, Andrew, this whole stock market thing, not for us."

Retail participation in equities didn't meaningfully recover until the 1960s, reflecting the depth of this psychological scarring. The eventual return occurred because "the market kept going up and people started to look at the market like they always do. And when they think that the train is leaving the station and they're not on the train, they think, I got to get on the train."

### Parallels to Contemporary Markets

While Sorkin deliberately avoided explicit comparisons in the book, several parallels emerged during the discussion:

**Leverage and Financial Products**: The current push to include "private credit and private equity and venture capital inside your retirement accounts and these sort of semi-liquid funds" echoes 1920s democratization efforts. Sorkin notes: "this whole idea of democratizing finance in the context of putting private credit and private equity and venture capital inside your retirement accounts...that's very 1929-ish to me."

**Technology Speculation**: AI investment parallels radio/RCA speculation, with both representing transformative technologies and uncapped market opportunities. However, Sorkin distinguishes that "NVIDIA makes a ton of money and it makes more money every year," whereas RCA's profitability remains unclear.

**Cryptocurrency and Investment Vehicles**: Sorkin identifies Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) as structurally similar to 1920s investment trusts, though he hedges: "I don't want to tell you that strategy is a 1929 style investment trust per se. I don't know."

**Regulatory Environment**: Sorkin expresses concern about current deregulatory trends: "my fear is we're living in a moment right now, actually, where some of those guardrails are almost purposely being taken away."

**CEO Behavior and Political Pressure**: Despite rhetoric about restored free speech, Sorkin observes that "I don't know any CEO right now that is particularly thrilled with the Trump administration per se." Business leaders face a calculation: "what's the trade-off? I think there are people who look at certain things happening in Washington and say, I don't like what's happening. If I raise my hand now...what is the upside for raising my hand and what is the downside?" The perceived downside is high given administration actions toward law firms, universities, and companies like Paramount CBS and Intel.

## Key Insights and Implications

1. **Leverage as the Fundamental Risk Factor**: Sorkin's central thesis is unequivocal: "Every financial crisis is a function of one thing, is leverage in the system, too much leverage. You actually can have speculators and all the bad actors you want doing all the bad things you can imagine on stage, but it's the leverage that tips it over."

2. **The Inadequacy of Self-Regulation**: Human nature makes self-regulation ineffective: "the human condition is to want more, right? That's what the investor class, I hate to say it, the idea of self-regulation is very, very difficult. People do not regulate themselves. They just don't."

3. **Policy Response Matters More Than the Initial Shock**: The Great Depression resulted not from the crash itself but from "a lot of bad decisions and dominoes that came after the crash itself." This suggests that crisis management and policy response are more critical than preventing all market corrections.

4. **Institutional Credibility and Political Constraints**: The Federal Reserve's ineffectiveness stemmed partly from its youth and fear of political backlash, illustrating how institutional legitimacy affects crisis response capabilities.

5. **Information Asymmetry Amplifies Volatility**: The hours-long delays in price information during 1929 created panic and prevented rational decision-making, suggesting that while modern technology enables faster trading, it may also enable faster information dissemination that could theoretically reduce some forms of panic.

6. **Generational Psychological Impact**: Financial crises create trauma that persists across generations, fundamentally altering risk tolerance and investment behavior for decades.

7. **The Danger of Overconfidence Following Success**: The successful resolution of the 1907 panic created dangerous overconfidence that "if you could just put the right people in a room together, we could solve anything," blinding leaders to systemic risks beyond their control.

## Definitions and Terminology

**Investment Trusts**: Pre-cursor to modern mutual funds, these vehicles pooled investor capital to purchase securities. In the 1920s, they often created "Russian dolls of leverage" through layered structures where trusts invested in other trusts, obscuring underlying risks and creating excessive leverage.

**Margin Lending/Buying on Margin**: Borrowing money to purchase securities, using the securities themselves as collateral. In 1929, investors could borrow $10 for every $1 of their own capital, creating 10:1 leverage ratios.

**Moral Suasion**: A central bank's use of persuasion rather than regulation or interest rate changes to influence behavior. The Federal Reserve attempted this in 1929 by sending letters requesting banks stop lending to speculators.

**Mitchellism**: Term coined by Senator Carter Glass to describe the proliferation of consumer credit and leverage in the financial system, named after Charles Mitchell of National City Bank.

**Hoovervilles**: Shanty towns that emerged during the Great Depression, named derisively after President Herbert Hoover, whom many blamed for the economic collapse.

**Vendor Financing**: Arrangements where a company provides financing to customers to purchase its products, potentially inflating revenue figures. Referenced in the context of NVIDIA's investments in companies that subsequently purchase NVIDIA products.

**Glass-Steagall**: Banking legislation (formally the Banking Act of 1933) that separated commercial and investment banking, co-authored by Senator Carter Glass in response to the 1929 crash and subsequent Depression.

## Methodology

Sorkin's research methodology for *1929* involved:

1. **Archival Research**: Extensive excavation of scattered historical materials including letters, memos, notes, and transcripts from multiple archives across the United States.

2. **Primary Source Documents**: Access to previously unavailable New York Federal Reserve board meeting minutes provided crucial insights into decision-making processes.

3. **Cross-Referencing**: Because key figures like Charles Mitchell "didn't keep his own notes," Sorkin relied on "finding other archives of letters and things that he participated in" to reconstruct events and motivations.

4. **Narrative Construction**: Inspired by Walter Lord's *A Night to Remember* (about the Titanic), Sorkin aimed to create a granular, human-centered narrative despite the absence of living witnesses to interview.

5. **Temporal Scope**: The book focuses primarily on the crash itself (first half) and immediate aftermath, deliberately avoiding extensive coverage of World War II and later recovery periods.

6. **Deliberate Avoidance of Presentism**: Sorkin and his editor made a conscious decision to never "stop the reader and take you out of 1929 and say, hey, by the way, this is kind of like that, or this is kind of like that," allowing readers to draw their own parallels.

The decade-long research process reflects both the difficulty of reconstructing detailed narratives from century-old events and Sorkin's commitment to achieving the same level of granular detail that characterized *Too Big to Fail*.
