## Executive Summary

This podcast episode features Andrew Ross Sorkin discussing his new book *1929: Inside the Greatest Crash in Wall Street History—and How It Shattered a Nation*. The conversation explores the 1929 stock market crash through detailed archival research, revealing striking parallels to contemporary market conditions, particularly regarding AI speculation, retail trading mania, and leverage in the financial system.

**Main Arguments:**
- The 1929 crash resulted from excessive leverage in the system, with retail investors able to borrow $10 for every $1 invested
- The crash itself was merely the first domino; subsequent policy failures (tariffs, Fed inaction, Treasury's punitive stance) created the Great Depression
- Modern parallels exist in AI speculation (RCA/radio as NVIDIA), democratization of finance, and potential removal of regulatory guardrails
- Every financial crisis fundamentally stems from excessive leverage, regardless of other contributing factors

**Key Historical Figures:**
- **Charles Mitchell**: Invented modern consumer credit for stock purchases, ran National City Bank (later Citigroup)
- **John Raskob**: Described as the "Elon Musk of the 1920s," involved in General Motors, politics, and built the Empire State Building
- **Carter Glass**: The "Elizabeth Warren of his time," warned against "Mitchellism" and excessive debt

**Central Thesis:** While technological innovation and speculation drive market enthusiasm, it is leverage that transforms speculation into systemic crisis. The 1929 crash shattered not just the economy but the national psyche for a generation, with effects lasting decades.

## Detailed Analysis

### The Book's Genesis and Research Challenges

Sorkin's decade-long research project faced significant obstacles. Unlike his previous work *Too Big to Fail* (covering the 2008 financial crisis), where he could interview living participants, the 1929 project required extensive archival work. Archivists initially warned him that "granular detail" would be difficult to find for this period.

The breakthrough came from accessing previously unavailable sources, particularly New York Federal Reserve board meeting minutes. Sorkin describes the process as "putting puzzle pieces together" across multiple archives rather than relying on a few major repositories. He explicitly avoided drawing contemporary parallels during most of the writing process, only recognizing similarities in the final two years of work.

### Key Historical Figures

**Charles Mitchell** emerged as the book's complex central figure. As head of National City Bank (predecessor to Citigroup), Mitchell "effectively invented sort of modern credit for lending, if you will, to individuals to go and buy stock." Sorkin compares his contemporary fame to Jamie Dimon, Michael Milken, or Dick Fuld. Mitchell served on the New York Fed board, creating inherent conflicts of interest. The character proved challenging to research due to lack of personal archives, requiring Sorkin to reconstruct his activities through correspondence and meeting minutes.

**John Raskob** represents the era's entrepreneurial excess. Sorkin characterizes him as "Elon Musk in the 1920s"—omnipresent, philosophically ambitious, and involved in multiple ventures simultaneously. Raskob:
- Helped run General Motors and pioneered consumer credit for automobile purchases
- Actively traded and speculated in markets
- Engaged in politics, attempting to undermine President Hoover's reputation
- Built the Empire State Building (described as "the equivalent of a spaceship")
- Advocated for the five-day work week, arguing it would boost economic activity by giving workers time and reason to spend money

**Carter Glass**, senator from Virginia and co-author of Glass-Steagall, served as the era's regulatory conscience. He helped create the Federal Reserve and spent years warning about "Mitchellism"—the dangerous proliferation of debt and leverage. His warnings went largely unheeded until after the crash validated his concerns.

### Retail Leverage and Market Infrastructure in 1929

The 1929 market featured unprecedented retail participation facilitated by extreme leverage. Sorkin describes brokerages "springing up on the corners of streets the way they're like Starbucks" in New York. The leverage ratios were extraordinary: "you would show up and you could give them a dollar and they would literally lend you 10."

Physical infrastructure included:
- Brokerage offices on street corners throughout major cities
- Trading lounges in hotels, including women-only facilities
- Brokerage services on cruise ships
- Limited disclosure requirements (pre-SEC era)

The democratization of finance represented a novel concept. Industry leaders explicitly drew parallels between consumer credit for automobiles and appliances and credit for stock purchases. As Sorkin notes, "they would say, OK, we've taught people that they can buy a car on margin or a car on credit or a dishwasher. Why not a stock?"

Information dissemination was severely limited. Investors received minimal documentation—"hardly had leaflets" rather than prospectuses. Dividend payments often required physical visits to brokerage houses. The lack of standardized financial reporting (P/E ratios, earnings statements) meant investors operated with minimal fundamental information.

### The Technology Parallel: RCA as the NVIDIA of 1929

RCA (Radio Corporation of America, ticker symbol: RADIO) served as the era's quintessential technology speculation vehicle. The company held patents for both radio and television technology, representing a transformative future. Sorkin identifies RCA as "the NVIDIA" and "the meme stock of that era."

The stock's trajectory illustrates the bubble's magnitude: at its peak, RCA reached approximately $530 per share (split-adjusted). By 1932, it traded at $3. Critically, unlike NVIDIA's substantial current profitability, RCA's financial performance remains unclear. Sorkin notes the absence of reliable financial data: "we don't know their P.E. ratio" due to minimal disclosure requirements.

This distinction matters: contemporary AI speculation involves companies with demonstrable revenue and earnings (though questions exist about sustainability, particularly regarding vendor financing arrangements). The 1929 speculation occurred with far less fundamental information, representing pure faith in technological transformation.

### Market Mania and Cultural Penetration

The stock market's cultural penetration in 1929 extended far beyond professional investors. Notable examples include:

**Winston Churchill**: Visited New York in October 1929, physically present on the stock exchange floor during the crash. He actively traded on margin and lost money. Churchill attended a dinner with leading bankers "the night that the market completely and utterly tanks."

**Groucho Marx**: According to his son, Marx spent more time at brokerage houses than at home in Long Island, watching the ticker tape daily. He ultimately had to mortgage his home to meet margin calls.

**Evangeline Adams**: An astrologer with an office in Carnegie Hall who was "taken shockingly seriously" by financiers, including J.P. Morgan before his death. She operated from the Plaza Hotel, where investors sought her advice. In October 1929, she held group sessions (described as "almost like seances") as crowds grew too large for individual consultations. Adams received credit for the market's rise after predicting in September 1929 that stocks would continue climbing.

### Federal Reserve's Role and Limitations

The Federal Reserve, established only in 1913, faced its first major crisis with institutional and political constraints. Sorkin argues the Fed "really did very little at the time and almost sat on their hands" for several reasons:

**Institutional Immaturity**: As a new institution, the Fed feared political backlash. Sorkin suggests they "couldn't have pulled off a Volcker-like move" because aggressive rate increases might have threatened the Fed's existence rather than merely costing officials their jobs.

**Policy Confusion**: In spring 1929, Fed officials recognized excessive speculation but struggled with implementation. Their primary tool—controlling margin lending rates—went largely unused. Instead, they attempted "moral suasion," sending letters to banks requesting they stop lending to speculators. This created confusion: "the bankers said, what are you talking about? How are you defined what a speculator is?"

**Conflicting Pressures**: Some banks, frightened by Fed warnings, stopped lending entirely, creating liquidity problems. Meanwhile, figures like Charles Mitchell publicly advocated for lower interest rates, creating a cacophony of competing demands.

**Information Lag**: The technological limitations compounded policy challenges. The New York Stock Exchange's "big board" fell behind actual prices "by hours." Even floor traders operated with delayed information, while investors in brokerage offices or on ships faced even greater delays.

### The Crash and Its Aftermath

Sorkin emphasizes that "the crash really happened over several days. It was not just one bad day." The immediate crash, however, represented only the beginning. The book's subtitle—"How It Shattered a Nation"—reflects the broader consequences.

**Policy Failures Created the Depression**: Sorkin identifies the crash as "the first domino of a series of things that were sort of the necessary ingredients to create the depression." Subsequent failures included:

1. **Smoot-Hawley Tariffs**: Protectionist trade policy that Sorkin "wasn't on my bingo card when I was writing that originally" but now resonates with current Trump administration policies
2. **Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon's Stance**: Mellon advocated letting speculators suffer, opposing relief measures
3. **Fed Inaction**: The Fed's continued passivity after the crash, failing to provide adequate liquidity or support
4. **Gold Standard Constraints**: Monetary policy limitations imposed by gold standard adherence

**Systemic Consequences**: The cascade of failures led to:
- 9,000 bank failures
- 25% unemployment
- "Hoovervilles" (shanty towns) in Central Park and throughout the country

**Generational Psychological Impact**: Sorkin shares a personal story illustrating the crash's lasting trauma. His grandfather, age 11 in 1929, had a brother working as a messenger boy who witnessed someone jump from a window during the crash. The grandfather "lived till he was 91 years old. And he never bought a share of stock in his entire life. Bought some bonds, never stock." This exemplifies how the crash "ripped apart generationally a psyche."

The recovery took decades. Retail participation in markets didn't substantially return until the 1960s. Sorkin attributes eventual recovery to post-World War II economic boom and the simple psychology that "when they think that the train is leaving the station and they're not on the train, they think, I got to get on the train."

### Contemporary Parallels and Warnings

While Sorkin deliberately avoided drawing explicit parallels in the book, the conversation identifies multiple contemporary resonances:

**AI Speculation**: Like radio/RCA in 1929, AI represents transformative technology with "basically uncapped" market opportunity—"the entire world. It's like all of business." The parallel extends to circular financing arrangements, with Sorkin noting concerns about "vendor financing sort of arrangements that should be raising questions."

**Democratization of Finance**: The 1920s concept of democratizing finance finds modern expression in efforts to place "private credit and private equity and venture capital inside your retirement accounts and these sort of semi-liquid funds." Sorkin describes this as "very 1929-ish to me."

**Investment Trusts and Modern Structures**: The 1920s investment trusts—"Russian dolls of leverage" where investors didn't "really even know what was inside of them"—find parallels in certain contemporary structures. Sorkin specifically mentions Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) as resembling an investment trust, though he carefully avoids definitive comparisons.

**Regulatory Rollback**: Sorkin expresses concern about current deregulation efforts: "my fear is we're living in a moment right now, actually, where some of those guardrails are almost purposely being taken away." He notes CEO enthusiasm for reduced reporting requirements (quarterly to semi-annual earnings) and other regulatory relief.

**CEO Self-Censorship**: Despite January 2025 rhetoric about restored free speech, Sorkin reports that CEOs remain reluctant to criticize the Trump administration. They conduct cost-benefit analyses: "there's very little upside actually, because the chance of real change in this moment right now is unlikely" while "the chance of it on the downside is high." He cites administration actions regarding law firms, universities, Paramount/CBS, and Intel stakes as creating "real implications if you're a business leader today."

**Overconfidence in Crisis Management**: The 1907 panic, resolved by J.P. Morgan gathering bankers in a room, created "a sort of sense of overconfidence" that "if you could just put the right people in a room together, we could solve anything." This parallels post-2008 confidence in central bank tools and government intervention capacity. Sorkin notes that 1907 occurred "literally 100 years before our crash, the great financial crisis," suggesting cyclical patterns of overconfidence.

## Key Insights and Implications

### The Primacy of Leverage

Sorkin's central lesson: "Every financial crisis is a function of one thing, is leverage in the system, too much leverage." He elaborates: "You actually can have speculators and all the bad actors you want doing all the bad things you can imagine on stage, but it's the leverage that tips it over."

This insight challenges narratives that focus on individual malfeasance, technological disruption, or speculative excess. While these factors contribute to bubbles, leverage transforms speculation into systemic crisis. The 10:1 margin ratios of 1929 meant that a 10% market decline wiped out investor equity entirely, triggering cascading margin calls and forced selling.

### Self-Regulation Fails

Sorkin argues forcefully against self-regulation: "the human condition is to want more, right? That's what the investor class, I hate to say it, the idea of self-regulation is very, very difficult. People do not regulate themselves. They just don't."

This observation applies across eras. The 1920s Fed's attempt at "moral suasion" failed because it relied on voluntary compliance against financial incentives. Contemporary deregulation efforts assume market discipline will prevent excess—an assumption contradicted by historical evidence.

### Information Asymmetry and Market Structure

The 1929 market operated with extreme information deficits: no prospectuses, minimal financial disclosure, hours-long delays in price information, and no standardized metrics. This created conditions where speculation divorced entirely from fundamentals.

Modern markets feature vastly superior information infrastructure, yet questions remain about complex financial products, private markets, and the quality of information regarding emerging technologies. The parallel suggests that information quality matters less than leverage levels in determining systemic risk.

### Policy Response Determines Depression vs. Recession

The crash itself didn't cause the Great Depression—policy failures did. This distinction matters critically for contemporary policymakers. The combination of tariffs, punitive Treasury stance, Fed passivity, and gold standard constraints transformed a market crash into economic catastrophe.

This suggests that current policy choices regarding tariffs, regulatory frameworks, and crisis response mechanisms may matter more than market valuations in determining economic outcomes.

### Generational Trauma and Market Participation

The psychological impact of 1929 lasted generations, fundamentally altering American attitudes toward equity investment for decades. This suggests that major market crashes have consequences extending far beyond immediate economic damage, potentially affecting capital formation, risk-taking, and economic dynamism for extended periods.

### The Inevitability of Parallel-Drawing

Despite Sorkin's efforts to avoid contemporary parallels during writing, both he and readers inevitably identify connections. As discussed: "when I read history of any sort, the brain can't help but try to find parallels to the present." This cognitive tendency means historical work always speaks to contemporary concerns, whether intended or not.

## Key Insights and Implications

### Timing and Market Cycles

The conversation occurs in 2025, four years before the 100-year anniversary of the 1929 crash. This temporal positioning adds resonance to discussions of current market conditions, though Sorkin emphasizes he began the project a decade earlier without anticipating contemporary relevance.

### The Role of Technology in Speculation

Both 1929 and today feature transformative technologies (radio/television vs. AI) driving speculative enthusiasm. The key difference: modern technology companies demonstrate substantial current profitability, whereas 1929-era companies operated with minimal financial transparency. This suggests current speculation may have firmer fundamental basis, though questions about sustainability (particularly vendor financing) remain.

### Physical vs. Digital Infrastructure

The 1929 market required physical presence—brokerages on street corners, trading lounges, trips to Wall Street during the crash to obtain information. Modern digital infrastructure enables instantaneous global participation, potentially accelerating both booms and busts. The 2023 banking crisis, with rumors spreading via social media and private chat groups, illustrates how technology changes crisis dynamics.

## Definitions and Terminology

**Margin Lending**: The practice of borrowing money to purchase securities, using the securities themselves as collateral. In 1929, margin requirements were minimal, allowing 10:1 leverage ratios (borrow $10 for every $1 invested).

**Investment Trusts**: Pre-mutual fund investment vehicles that pooled investor capital. In the 1920s, these often featured "Russian dolls of leverage"—trusts investing in other trusts, creating layered leverage with minimal transparency.

**Mitchellism**: Term coined by Senator Carter Glass referring to Charles Mitchell's promotion of consumer credit and leverage, which Glass believed would destabilize the financial system.

**Moral Suasion**: Central bank policy tool involving persuasion and informal pressure rather than formal regulatory action. The Fed's 1929 letters requesting banks stop lending to speculators exemplified this approach.

**Hoovervilles**: Shanty towns named after President Herbert Hoover that emerged during the Great Depression, housing unemployed and displaced Americans. Sorkin notes these existed "literally in Central Park" in New York.

**Vendor Financing**: Arrangements where a company provides financing to customers to purchase its products. Contemporary concerns focus on AI companies investing in startups that then purchase their services, potentially inflating revenue.

**Glass-Steagall**: Banking legislation (formally the Banking Act of 1933) that separated commercial and investment banking, co-authored by Senator Carter Glass in response to 1929 crash and subsequent bank failures.

**Smoot-Hawley Tariff**: The Tariff Act of 1930, which raised U.S. tariffs on thousands of imported goods, widely considered to have worsened the Great Depression by reducing international trade.

## Methodology

### Research Approach

Sorkin's methodology involved extensive archival research across multiple repositories over approximately ten years. Key sources included:

1. **Federal Reserve Archives**: Previously unavailable New York Fed board meeting minutes provided crucial insights into policy debates and Charles Mitchell's role as board member
2. **Personal Correspondence**: Letters and memos from various archives helped reconstruct activities of figures like Mitchell who left no personal archive
3. **Contemporary Accounts**: Newspapers, newsletters (including astrologer Evangeline Adams's publications), and other period documents
4. **Family Histories**: Personal stories (like Groucho Marx's son's accounts) provided texture and human detail

### Writing Philosophy

Sorkin made deliberate choices to enhance historical immersion:

- **No Anachronistic Commentary**: The book never "stops the reader and takes you out of 1929" to explicitly draw contemporary parallels
- **Character-Driven Narrative**: Following the model of *A Night to Remember* (about the Titanic), Sorkin focused on individual experiences to "make things feel human"
- **Granular Detail**: Despite archivists' warnings, Sorkin pursued the same level of detail as *Too Big to Fail*, reconstructing specific conversations and moments

### Limitations and Uncertainties

Sorkin acknowledges several limitations:

- **Financial Data Gaps**: Lack of prospectuses, standardized financial reporting, and disclosure requirements means precise valuations and financial conditions remain unclear
- **Incomplete Archives**: Some key figures (particularly Charles Mitchell) left minimal personal records, requiring reconstruction through indirect sources
- **Dividend Distribution Mechanics**: Specific details about how investors received and managed dividends remain somewhat uncertain
