## Executive Summary

This podcast episode from Bloomberg's Odd Lots examines the fundamental shift in interest rates between 2019 and 2025, exploring why the neutral rate of interest (R-star) has increased substantially. The discussion features Tom Orlik (Chief Economist at Bloomberg Economics) and Jamie Rush (Director of Global Economics at Bloomberg Economics), who have co-authored "The Price of Money: A Guide to the Past, Present, and Future of the Natural Rate of Interest" with Stephanie Flanders.

**Core Argument:** The neutral rate of interest has risen significantly due to a fundamental reversal in the global economy's savings-investment balance. From the late 1980s to mid-2010s, excess savings and insufficient investment drove neutral rates downward. This dynamic has reversed, with decreased savings and increased investment demand pushing borrowing costs higher.

**Key Quantitative Change:** The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield increased from approximately 1.8% in December 2019 to over 4.12% by late 2025, representing a regime change in the cost of borrowing.

**The Five D's Framework:** The authors identify five primary drivers pushing neutral rates higher:
1. **Demographics** - Baby boomers transitioning from saving to spending in retirement
2. **Debt** - Massive increases in government borrowing post-financial crisis and post-pandemic
3. **Deglobalization** - Breakdown of global trade arrangements and capital flows
4. **Data Centers** - AI-driven investment boom requiring substantial capital expenditure
5. **Defense** - Rising military spending across advanced economies

**Policy Implications:** The analysis directly contradicts recent arguments from Fed Governor Stephen Myron, who contends that R-star should be near zero, implying the need for aggressive rate cuts. The Bloomberg Economics model suggests the opposite: structural forces justify sustainably higher interest rates.

## Detailed Analysis

### The Neutral Rate of Interest: Definition and Framework

The neutral rate of interest (R-star) is defined as **"what balances demand for investment and saving in the economy. And when those two things are in balance, the economy is on trend and inflation is roughly at target."** This conceptual framework treats the interest rate as the price of money, determined by supply (savings) and demand (investment) dynamics.

**Historical Context:** Prior to the 2008 financial crisis, monetary policy appeared to function predictably—interest rates moved up and down, and the economy responded according to textbook expectations. The post-crisis period fundamentally changed this dynamic. Despite interest rates at zero and extensive quantitative easing, unemployment remained stubbornly high and growth persistently weak. This paradox elevated R-star's importance as an explanatory framework.

The concept gained particular prominence around 2016, when Goldman Sachs noted that Federal Reserve mentions of R-star increased dramatically after essentially no discussion in the previous decade. This resurgence reflected policymakers' need to explain why monetary policy appeared ineffective despite unprecedented accommodation.

**The 2010s Puzzle:** During this period, nominal interest rates at or near zero coexisted with persistent economic weakness. While financial press commentary often characterized Fed policy as "super loose" or criticized "money printing," actual economic outcomes—undershooting inflation and elevated unemployment—suggested monetary policy remained effectively tight even at the zero lower bound. This apparent contradiction highlighted the importance of understanding where the neutral rate actually stood.

### The Resurgence of R-Star as a Policy Concept

R-star's renewed prominence stems from a fundamental shift in economic conditions. Tom Orlik explains: **"From the late 1980s to the mid-2010s, the global economy was characterized by too much saving and not enough investment. And in that state of affairs, the neutral rate of interest, the cost of borrowing was continually falling. What's happened in the last decade? Well, that dynamic has swung into reverse. And now we have less saving, more investment. And that means the neutral rate of interest, the cost of borrowing for the US Treasury and for everyone else is going up."**

The practical implications are substantial. During the pre-COVID era, governments could effectively be paid to borrow in real terms. Treasury yields were so low across the yield curve that borrowing costs were negligible, enabling the massive fiscal responses observed during the pandemic. The current environment, with real treasury yields exceeding 4%, represents a fundamentally different fiscal constraint.

**Contemporary Controversy:** Stephen Myron's first public speech as a Fed board member focused entirely on R-star, arguing it should be near zero—dramatically lower than conventional estimates of 3.3% to 3.9%. This divergence matters enormously for policy: if R-star is low, current rates appear highly restrictive, justifying aggressive cuts. If R-star is high, current policy may not be restrictive at all.

Jamie Rush notes a strategic dimension to R-star debates: **"With R-star, you're never beholden to a prediction, really, are you? So if you say, I think interest rates should be lower because the economy is going to tank, and then the economy doesn't tank, you just look like a bit of an idiot. But if you say, I think rates should be lower because R-star is actually lower, then no one's ever going to come along and say, oh, actually, you are completely wrong because I've got irrefutable proof that R-star was actually, in fact, higher."** This observation suggests R-star can function as an unfalsifiable justification for preferred policy positions.

### Modeling Approaches: LBW vs. Supply-Demand Framework

The conventional approach to estimating R-star is the Laubach-Williams (LBW) model, which infers the neutral rate by observing inflation and unemployment outcomes. If interest rates are far above neutral (highly restrictive), inflation should be very low and unemployment very high, and vice versa. This method provides real-time estimates based on observable data but offers no insight into why R-star is at any particular level or where it might be heading.

**Bloomberg Economics' Alternative Approach:** Jamie Rush describes their methodology: **"What we tried to do was pin the natural rate down by using some actual data and some theory. So if we think about what the natural rate is and what it is that determines, well, it's the price of money, and that's determined in the same way as anything else is determined, by the supply and the demand."**

Their model explicitly incorporates:
- **Investment demand drivers:** Capital expenditure needs driven by technological change, productivity growth, and frontier technologies
- **Savings supply drivers:** Demographic factors (age-dependent saving behavior), government fiscal positions, and cross-border capital flows

The model estimates relationships between these fundamental drivers and interest rates over approximately 50 years of data. This approach enables forward-looking analysis: by projecting how these drivers will evolve, the model can anticipate R-star's trajectory.

**Investment Definition:** The model focuses specifically on capital expenditure. Using AI as an example, Rush explains: **"AI is great. I can't do it on a Casio calculator. I have to buy something to make it work. I have to spend money. I have to invest in chips, in fabs to reap the benefits of those frontier technologies. So as AI lifts the growth rate of the economy, it also raises the investment needs."**

**Savings Definition:** Savings encompasses both individual behavior (working-age individuals saving for retirement, then spending down in retirement) and state actors' decisions. China's evolution from high-saving to lower-saving economy exemplifies how state-level changes affect global capital availability.

### The Five D's: Primary Drivers of Rising Neutral Rates

#### 1. Demographics

Tom Orlik identifies demographics as the first major driver: **"For decades, we had the baby boomers in prime working age, saving money for retirement. That pushed the neutral rate down. Now they're retiring, spending down their savings. That's a powerful force pushing the neutral rate up."**

This represents a generational shift with profound implications. From the 1980s onward, baby boomers' high savings rates increased capital supply, depressing interest rates. Tracy Alloway characterizes this as "generational warfare," noting it explains why she "never earned interest on my bank account until two years ago." As this cohort transitions to retirement, they shift from net savers to net spenders, fundamentally altering the savings-investment balance.

#### 2. Debt (Government Dis-saving)

Jamie Rush identifies government spending as **"the main driver really is dis-saving by governments or spending by governments."** The pandemic experience revealed that **"governments like to spend and they've continued to do so even though it's become more costly."**

Several factors perpetuate high government spending:
- **Political fragmentation:** Difficulty achieving consensus around deficit reduction
- **Aging populations:** Increasing outlays for healthcare, pensions, and social benefits
- **Defense spending:** Rising military expenditures across advanced economies
- **Energy transition:** Infrastructure investments for decarbonization

Tom Orlik provides historical context: **"For decades from the 1980s to the global financial crisis, borrowing from the US and from other major advanced economies, leaving aside Japan, was low and stable. Since the global financial crisis, and again since the COVID pandemic, there's been a massive increase in government borrowing."**

#### 3. Deglobalization

The breakdown of global trade and capital flow arrangements represents a fundamental shift. Orlik frames this as the end of a "grand bargain": **"One way of thinking about the last few decades is America said to the world, we will buy your stuff and we will defend you, but you have to finance us. You have to send your saving to the United States by US treasuries. But what the Trump administration now is saying is, well, we're not going to buy your stuff and we're not going to defend you."**

This has multiple dimensions:
- **China's FX policy shift:** For over a decade, China pegged the yuan to the dollar, requiring the PBOC to purchase massive quantities of U.S. Treasuries. This policy has changed, reducing demand for dollar assets.
- **Geopolitical risk:** The freezing of Russia's FX reserves following the Ukraine invasion signaled that dollar holdings carry political risk, incentivizing diversification.
- **Tariff policies:** High tariffs reduce U.S. participation in global trade, decreasing the utility of holding dollars for transaction purposes.

Deglobalization also affects investment costs. Dan Hansen's contribution to the book examines how globalization reduced investment goods prices. Computing power per dollar increased dramatically from 1980 to present due to productivity gains and global supply chains. If globalization reverses, **"the cost of investment goods is going to stop falling. You're going to need to pay more to buy a certain amount of technology, a certain amount of investment goods."**

Additionally, deglobalization increases investment demand through redundancy: **"If everyone wants to make their own stuff at home, then clearly there has to be a massive amount of capital spending so everyone can build their own everything, right? We can't just have semiconductor fabs in Taiwan. We need semiconductor fabs in Germany and Japan and the United States."**

#### 4. Data Centers (AI Investment)

Jamie Rush notes that when they began writing the book, **"ChatGPT wasn't really a thing. That's when we started out. By the time we published the book, it's very much a thing."** AI's transformational impact on investment is already visible, with their scenario analysis suggesting substantial upward pressure on R-star now materializing.

Jason Furman has characterized AI spending as "quasi-fiscal in nature" due to massive capital inflows preceding productivity payoffs, creating potential crowding-out effects. Neil Kashkari raised the question of whether different sectors might have different neutral rates—AI investment might justify high rates for the tech sector while the housing sector requires lower rates for balance.

Rush acknowledges this complexity: **"Maybe there's an R-star which keeps the economy balanced, and maybe there's an R star which keeps the financial sector and financial markets balanced and not getting carried away with themselves. And there's no guarantee or any particular reason to think that they should be the same, which implies then that you've got this policy trade-off."**

#### 5. Defense

While not elaborated extensively in the discussion, defense spending represents the fifth D. Rising military expenditures across advanced economies, driven by geopolitical tensions and the breakdown of post-Cold War security arrangements, constitute another source of increased government spending and investment demand.

### Trump Administration Policies and R-Star

The Bloomberg Economics analysis directly contradicts Stephen Myron's argument that Trump policies lower R-star. Orlik explains: **"If you think about the policies of the Trump administration, well, firstly, we've got the one big beautiful bill, which adds trillions and trillions of dollars to government borrowing over the next decade. That significantly pushes up the neutral rate of interest."**

More broadly, Trump's approach represents **"the end of the grand bargain which America has struck with the world."** If the U.S. neither buys other countries' goods nor provides security guarantees, the rest of the world has diminished incentive to finance U.S. deficits by purchasing Treasuries. This reduces demand for U.S. debt, pushing borrowing costs higher.

The tariff policies themselves shift the international savings-investment balance. Rush notes: **"If you can't find anywhere else any other assets to buy in place of U.S. Treasuries, what are you going to do? Well, quite possibly you'll end up spending them. And particularly if you think about the geopolitical context, you think about the impact of tariffs on China, for example. Well, now there's actually an extra incentive to spend more."**

### De-dollarization and Global Capital Flows

Multiple factors drive reduced dollar demand:

1. **China's FX policy evolution:** The end of yuan-dollar pegging eliminated the need to accumulate massive Treasury holdings
2. **Geopolitical weaponization:** Freezing Russia's reserves demonstrated political risk in dollar holdings
3. **Reduced trade integration:** Lower U.S. participation in global trade decreases dollar utility for transactions

Orlik summarizes: **"If the rest of the world is de-dollarizing, that also means they're buying less US treasuries. That means less demand for US treasuries. And so it's another force pushing US borrowing costs higher."**

The correlation between dollar demand and Treasury demand is strong in this context. As countries seek alternatives to dollar reserves, they simultaneously reduce Treasury purchases, directly affecting U.S. borrowing costs.

### Central Bank Independence and Credibility Concerns

Tom Orlik identifies threats to central bank independence as an additional factor potentially pushing rates higher: **"We've talked about Stephen Myron coming onto the Board of Governors at the Fed. Well, guess what? He's still holding on to his position as the chair of the Council of Economic Advisors, senior member of Donald Trump's economic policy team. Concurrently, that's unprecedented going back to 1936 and raises significant questions about Fed independence and so the Fed's credibility as an inflation fighter."**

If the Fed loses credibility, **"markets are going to start demanding an additional premium to hold long-term US Treasury debt."** This risk premium would compound the structural forces already pushing rates higher.

Orlik notes bipartisan concern: **"There's not much which Republicans and Democrats agree on in America right now. One point of bipartisan consensus, unfortunately, is that there's too much politics in the Fed."** He argues this politicization began before Trump, pointing to rate cuts preceding the 2024 election as evidence of the Fed diverging from a "pure, apolitical, Taylor rule path."

The question of whether the Fed still seriously targets 2% inflation has gained prominence. Bloomberg's Anna Wong argues that Fed behavior suggests an implicit target of 2.8%. Tim Duy contends that below 3% inflation, the Fed prioritizes the employment mandate. This potential shift in the inflation target itself has implications for long-term rate expectations.

### Supply Shocks and Central Bank Policy

Jamie Rush identifies a fundamental shift in the nature of economic shocks: **"History was dominated, at least in the last couple of decades, by demand shocks. And now we're seeing a world which is dominated increasingly by supply shocks. And actually, it's just a different playbook for central banks."**

Climate change will increase supply shock frequency: **"Climate change is going to make it harder to produce stuff. It's going to make food price shocks more common. It's going to create other distortions which hit production."** Central banks may need to maintain higher rates to prevent supply shocks from becoming embedded in inflation expectations.

This raises a fundamental policy challenge: raising interest rates cannot directly produce more wheat, shipping capacity, or semiconductor chips. The traditional monetary policy toolkit is less effective against supply constraints than demand imbalances.

## Key Insights and Implications

1. **R-Star as Unfalsifiable Policy Justification:** The unobservable nature of R-star enables its use as a rhetorical device to support predetermined policy preferences without accountability. Policymakers can advocate for higher or lower rates by asserting R-star has moved, with limited ability for empirical refutation.

2. **The Paradox of Monetary Policy Effectiveness:** The 2020s witnessed the largest interest rate increases in decades with minimal impact on growth or employment trajectories. This challenges fundamental assumptions about monetary policy transmission mechanisms and suggests the economy's sensitivity to rate changes may be lower than traditionally believed.

3. **Sectoral Heterogeneity in Neutral Rates:** Different sectors may have different neutral rates. AI investment might justify high rates for tech, while housing requires lower rates. This creates an impossible policy dilemma: a single interest rate cannot simultaneously balance multiple sectors with divergent equilibrium rates.

4. **The End of the "Grand Bargain":** The post-WWII arrangement where the U.S. provided security and market access in exchange for financing is dissolving. This has profound implications for U.S. borrowing costs and global capital allocation.

5. **Generational Wealth Transfer Dynamics:** The baby boomer transition from saving to spending represents a multi-decade demographic wave with first-order effects on interest rates. This is not a cyclical phenomenon but a structural shift.

6. **Supply Shocks as the New Normal:** Climate change, deglobalization, and geopolitical fragmentation will make supply shocks more frequent. Central banks face a fundamentally different challenge than the demand-shock-dominated era of the Great Moderation.

7. **Asset Prices in a Higher-Rate Environment:** The relationship between interest rates and asset prices may decouple if productivity gains from AI materialize. Equity values could rise alongside interest rates if investment returns justify both higher capital costs and higher valuations.

8. **Political Economy of Deficit Reduction:** Political fragmentation makes deficit reduction increasingly difficult across advanced democracies. This structural political constraint has economic consequences through persistently higher government borrowing.

## Definitions and Terminology

**R-Star (Neutral Rate of Interest):** The interest rate that balances investment demand and savings supply such that the economy operates at trend growth with inflation at target. Also termed the "natural rate of interest."

**Laubach-Williams (LBW) Model:** A conventional approach to estimating R-star that infers the neutral rate from observed inflation and unemployment outcomes, assuming restrictive policy produces low inflation and high unemployment.

**Investment (in this context):** Specifically capital expenditure—spending on physical assets, technology, infrastructure, and productive capacity. Distinct from financial investment.

**Savings (in this context):** The supply of capital available for lending, encompassing both individual savings behavior and state-level capital allocation decisions.

**Zero Interest Rate Policy (ZIRP):** Monetary policy regime where nominal interest rates are at or near zero.

**Term Premium:** The additional yield investors demand for holding longer-term bonds versus rolling over short-term bonds. (Referenced but not central to the discussion.)

**Taylor Rule:** A monetary policy guideline suggesting how central banks should adjust interest rates in response to inflation and output gaps.

**Savings Glut Hypothesis:** Ben Bernanke's theory that excess savings from China, oil-exporting nations, and other sources flowed into the U.S., depressing interest rates.

**Deglobalization:** The reversal of global economic integration, characterized by reduced trade flows, capital flow restrictions, and increased economic nationalism.

**Quasi-Fiscal Policy:** Private sector spending (like AI investment) that has economic effects similar to government fiscal policy due to its scale and timing.

## Methodology

The Bloomberg Economics model employs a supply-demand framework to estimate R-star:

**Theoretical Foundation:**
- Interest rates are the price of money
- Price is determined by supply (savings) and demand (investment)
- Identify theoretical drivers of savings and investment behavior
- Estimate empirical relationships between these drivers and interest rates

**Data Inputs:**
- Demographics (age structure, population growth)
- Government fiscal positions (deficits, debt levels)
- Productivity growth rates
- Technology adoption and capital requirements
- Cross-border capital flows
- Trade balances and current account positions

**Estimation Approach:**
- Historical data spanning approximately 50 years
- Econometric estimation of relationships between drivers and interest rates
- Validation against observed rate movements

**Forward-Looking Analysis:**
- Project evolution of fundamental drivers (demographics, fiscal policy, technology, geopolitics)
- Apply estimated relationships to generate R-star forecasts
- Scenario analysis for alternative futures (e.g., AI impact scenarios)

**Key Distinction from LBW Model:**
- LBW: Backward-looking, infers R-star from outcomes
- Bloomberg Economics: Forward-looking, builds R-star from fundamentals

**Limitations Acknowledged:**
- R-star remains unobservable; model produces estimates, not certainties
- Structural breaks and regime changes can invalidate historical relationships
- Multiple equilibria possible (sectoral heterogeneity)
- Political and policy uncertainty difficult to quantify
