## Executive Summary

This episode of the Tokenized podcast examines the intersection of traditional finance and blockchain technology through discussions on euro stablecoin adoption, tokenized deposits, and the evolving landscape of digital currencies. The conversation features Eric Queathem (Co-Founder at Velocity), Marieke Flament (2x CEO, Angel Investor, and Co-Author of Euro Stable Watch), Simon Taylor (GTM at Tempo), and Cuy Sheffield (Head of Crypto at Visa).

**Core Arguments:**

1. **Euro Stablecoin Market Gap**: Despite 99% of stablecoins being dollar-denominated, Europe faces significant challenges in developing competitive euro stablecoins due to structural differences from the US, including fragmented bond markets and lack of unified treasury instruments.

2. **Yield as Strategic Tool**: High-yield products on stablecoins serve dual purposes as customer acquisition mechanisms and geopolitical instruments for currency competition, with implications extending beyond simple financial returns.

3. **Tokenized Deposits as Middle Ground**: Banks are exploring tokenized deposits as a compromise between CBDCs and private stablecoins, with the UK's regulated liability network approach representing a potential model for maintaining banking relevance in the blockchain era.

4. **Corporate Treasury Transformation**: Global corporations are driving demand for blockchain-based treasury solutions, with companies like Alipay/Ant International leading the shift toward tokenized settlement and 24/7 capital management.

5. **Tether's Multifaceted Strategy**: Tether's expansion into tokenized gold, mining infrastructure, and selective regulatory compliance represents a long-term positioning strategy that balances immediate dollar demand with preparation for potential monetary system shifts.

## Detailed Analysis

### Euro Stablecoin Adoption Challenges

The European stablecoin market faces fundamental structural challenges that differentiate it from the US dollar stablecoin ecosystem. Marieke Flament contextualizes the problem: "99% of stable coins are still in dollar. Those are the rails of the future...having no euro presence is a very big deal."

**Structural Impediments:**

The European financial architecture lacks the unified treasury instrument that underpins US dollar stablecoins. As Simon Taylor notes, "Europe doesn't have treasury bills. Like there isn't an ECB bill. There's lots of different debt markets from all of the 27 member countries." This fragmentation creates collateral challenges for euro-backed stablecoins that don't exist for USDC or USDT.

**Consortium Approach:**

Nine European banks announced a consortium to launch a euro stablecoin, which Flament describes as "a very good setup, given how Europe is constructed, given also the history of the euro and how the euro started." This consortium model acknowledges that European financial infrastructure requires collaborative rather than unilateral approaches due to the decentralized nature of European banking and sovereign debt markets.

**Regulatory Confusion:**

Significant confusion exists between the European Central Bank's (ECB) digital euro project and private stablecoin initiatives. The Central Bank of France has begun discussing "a new stack of money which could encompass stablecoins and tokenized deposits and wholesale CBDC," suggesting evolving regulatory thinking that moves beyond binary CBDC-versus-stablecoin frameworks.

**Market Readiness Concerns:**

Eric Queathem expresses skepticism about current euro stablecoin proposals: "There's nothing in this that I think gets businesses around the world excited to hold a euro-backed stablecoin versus kind of what's in the market today...the regulatory framework doesn't provide yield or clear reward sharing, and the economics don't look better than alternatives out in the market."

### Digital Euro and CBDC Development

The ECB announced agreements with seven vendors for digital euro components, targeting a potential 2029 launch. This timeline drew criticism from multiple panelists.

**Timeline Challenges:**

Cuy Sheffield highlights the fundamental problem with long development cycles: "It's just so hard to design a product in 2025 to be launched in 2029 on the consumer side...Most consumer product cycles, you're iterating, you're launching something, you're iterating, you're launching. When you're saying, okay, we have to hit, what is the market going to look like in 2029? It's just really, really hard to imagine."

**Wholesale vs. Retail Focus:**

Flament questions the retail CBDC focus: "The digital euro itself, it's a retail CBDC. Do we need that? I would still question that. I think actually for the ECB to focus on a wholesale CBDC is probably the right focus." She suggests the 2029 timeline might represent "a stalling tactic" given that ECB leadership will change significantly by then.

**Vendor Selection:**

The selection of vendors like G+D (Giesecke+Devrient), a company from the 1800s that originally printed physical banknotes, illustrates the tension between legacy infrastructure providers and the pace of technological change. Sheffield notes this represents "an amazing story of they literally printed physical banknotes. Like that was the core business. And now they're more kind of digital security company involved in CBDC."

**Settlement Infrastructure:**

Despite concerns about the retail CBDC timeline, the wholesale CBDC work shows more progress, with actual testing and sandbox implementations. This wholesale focus addresses a critical inefficiency: "one of the big inefficiencies in the stablecoin market is true settlement...today's settlement ultimately rolls back to a central bank balance sheet if you want zero risk settlement."

### Corporate Treasury Management Evolution

Alipay and Ant International emerge as leaders in next-generation treasury management, with implications for global corporate finance.

**Alipay's Proactive Approach:**

Queathem reveals: "I remember a conversation in my prior life where they came to us in an organization and said, hey, look, if you guys aren't willing to settle in some form of digital asset, it will be hard for you to remain a vendor of us in the future. And that was three or four years ago." This demonstrates how major corporations are forcing banking partners toward tokenization.

**Recent Partnerships:**

Alipay launched BRUER, a stablecoin listed by European financial regulator ESMA and issued in Luxembourg. They've also partnered with Connexus for GBP FX to euro and dollar, and with HSBC for similar services. These partnerships represent "the second wave of what they've been quietly building, which is taking lots of learnings and functionality that they built internally to optimize their global business, and now starting to externalize that into different consumer products."

**Corporate Pain Points:**

Queathem identifies universal challenges: "Every global business around the world is burdened with either speed issues in terms of getting money into the right regulated or unregulated entities around the world, having that capital available to meet their payable needs, moving funds into the right corridors...And then also just the practical cost of no matter how big you are as an organization, banking fees, you know, in many cases are egregious."

**Banking Economics:**

A revealing anecdote from a closed-door panel: "an individual who used to work at one of the largest banks in the world said, look, at the end of the day, we're chasing FX." This admission exposes the fundamental business model tension between banks' profit centers and corporate clients' efficiency needs.

**Alipay Plus Network:**

Sheffield discusses the wallet interoperability challenge: "Alipay Plus is a network of many wallets that they've partnered with...if you want to do wallet interoperability, if you want to be able to accept a Grab wallet or an Alipay wallet or many of the other wallets they work with, there's that challenge of how do you do settlement?" Stablecoins like XSGD (Straits X in Singapore) provide backend settlement solutions for cross-wallet transactions.

### High-Yield Products and DeFi Integration

The proliferation of high-yield stablecoin products represents a significant market development with multiple interpretations.

**Market Landscape:**

Recent launches include:
- SG Forge (Société Générale) partnering with Morpho Labs offering 10% APY on EuroCV
- Trust Wallet enabling up to 7.4% on stablecoin yield
- Galaxy One launching 8% premium yield on cash in stablecoins for accredited investors
- Coinbase previously offered 10% APY on USDC (though later rolled back)

**Yield Sustainability Debate:**

Queathem acknowledges rate environment dependency: "I think the current environment is probably one that doesn't last forever. But I think it's also hard to imagine that we get back to a zero rate environment." He emphasizes behavioral change over absolute yield levels: "What's going to be really interesting is what happens when the rate environment goes down. Do they also then kind of reset their expectations that, hey, I'm actually fine for money to move in 24, 48, or sometimes even longer?"

**Control and Optionality:**

The key insight is that users become "addicted to the control they have at which they can put capital in different places." Even if yields decrease, the ability to move money instantly and manage treasury on-demand represents a fundamental shift in expectations. Queathem predicts: "I think it will be hard. I don't imagine a lot of what goes on chain coming off chain just because of that."

**DeFi Infrastructure Maturation:**

Sheffield presents the "DeFi mullet thesis" - that infrastructure for on-chain credit protocols is "getting hardened and mature enough in the user experiences. You can actually create a product that looks and feels like a neobank, but in the back end, you're actually spinning up a self-custodial wallet and depositing into Morpho."

**Yield Composition:**

Sheffield explains the yield stacking: "It's almost like it's stacking the 4% rewards that they're getting passing back, plus another 6%. And then many of these protocols are also enabling token incentives on top of it." This creates complex yield structures with varying risk profiles.

**Banking Concerns:**

The US Treasury cited a statistic that "$6.6 trillion of deposits were at risk of flight from financial institutions." For community banks, this represents existential risk as deposits fund their lending operations. However, Taylor argues: "the smart banks here are the ones seeing the opportunity more than the risk," drawing parallels to sponsor banks that emerged after the Durban Amendment.

**Banks' Competitive Advantages:**

Taylor emphasizes banks' unique capabilities: "Having a balance sheet is an amazing thing, especially in the on-chain world where the only type of lending is over-collateralized today. Banks are allowed to create credit. That's a hugely useful thing and something that the on-chain market doesn't have."

### Yield as Geopolitical Strategy

Flament introduces a critical geopolitical dimension often overlooked in yield discussions.

**Customer Acquisition Tool:**

"Ultimately it's a customer acquisition tool...we are in a market which is highly competitive, which has hundreds of different projects coming all the time where network effects matter. And therefore, of course, there's going to be yield and people are going to find yield in every possible place to make sure that you can actually get adoption and customer adoption."

**Currency Competition:**

The strategic implication extends beyond individual businesses: "There is beyond businesses wanting to get customers. There is also actually nations who are going to start thinking that way to think, well, how do I get the euro more used? How do I get the Chinese yuan more used? How do I get the dollar more used?"

**European Dollar Adoption:**

A counterintuitive phenomenon: "In Europe, we have more and more people who are using also dollar-denominated stablecoins. Because it means that with your dollar-denominated stablecoins in Europe, by the way, you can get more yield." This represents currency substitution driven by yield opportunities, with geopolitical implications for monetary sovereignty.

**Optionality and Control:**

"The problem is that now you have options...now people understand how they can move money. They understand how they can actually put their money to work on their terms, how they decide it." This shift in user expectations creates pressure on traditional banking systems and national currencies that cannot offer competitive yields or flexibility.

### Tokenized Deposits and Banking Innovation

Tokenized deposits represent banks' strategic response to stablecoin competition, with varying approaches across jurisdictions.

**BNY Mellon's Testing:**

BNY Mellon announced testing of tokenized deposits for blockchain payments. As a major custodian bank, BNY's role is particularly significant. Taylor explains: "Custodian banks are the ones who custody the assets and they manage all of the treasury life cycles sitting around it...these guys are really, really crucial to the global financial system."

**UK's Regulated Liability Network:**

Flament highlights the UK approach as particularly noteworthy: "In the UK there are banks that have been strongly nudged by the central banks...maybe you should look at tokenized deposit then wouldn't it be great if you come together and do tokenized deposit and please do tokenized deposit and start to figure things out."

**Open Banking Parallel:**

Flament draws a historical parallel: "This tokenized deposits approach from the UK has to me the same feeling of like, how do you actually make bank be more relevant...that to me reminds me a little bit of open banking you know when open banking arrived and you had like a whole flurry of banks and no no no and then they were actually forced and pushed to say well you should actually open your data and there should be API to be able to do that."

**Three-Layer Stack:**

The emerging framework envisions: "A world where you have wholesale CBDC, tokenized deposits, and then stablecoin." This layered approach allows different instruments to serve different purposes while maintaining roles for central banks, commercial banks, and fintech innovators.

**Volume Concerns:**

Flament notes a critical limitation: "Right now there's a lot of headlines, but there is no volume. Literally, I was trying to look for volumes of tokenized deposits. I think there is like literally none today." This gap between announcement and adoption remains significant.

**Quant Network and Vocalink:**

The UK's GBPT (tokenized British pound) is provided by Quant Network, whose founder came from Vocalink - the operator of the UK's Faster Payments system, the world's first instant payments rail (launched 2005). This lineage suggests institutional knowledge transfer from previous payment innovations.

**Sheffield's Skepticism:**

Sheffield questions universal applicability: "It remains to be seen to me if it makes sense for every bank or most banks to tokenize their deposits anytime in the kind of near to midterm...for a regional bank in a certain country, like tokenizing their deposits, how does that help? And what does it look like?"

**Two Clear Use Cases:**

Sheffield identifies specific scenarios where tokenized deposits make sense:

1. **Corporate Treasury (Intra-company movement)**: "If you're a JPM large corporate that has accounts at JPM, you have accounts at JPM in the US and Singapore and London, being able to use Connexus to move money between those accounts, that makes a ton of sense." JPM Coin and Connexus represent "arguably, they're the most successful tokenized deposit that's operating at scale solving a real problem for corporates."

2. **Stablecoin Reserve Banking**: "For the reserve banks for stable coins...BNY, this makes a lot of sense...They've become one of the larger reserve banks, reserve custodians behind some of the major stablecoins right now." Enabling 24/7 minting and redemption of stablecoins requires tokenized deposits: "If tokenized deposits enable BNY to offer more efficient, more frequent money movement between a customer of BNY and their stablecoin issuers who are customers of BNY, and you can then go from a BNY deposit into USDC and back to BNY deposit 24-7, that is super valuable."

**Closed Loop vs. Open Loop Challenge:**

Taylor identifies a critical adoption barrier: "There are a lot of good closed loop blockchains right now...Connexus, Citi HSBC token services these things are all built on EVM compatible blockchains...but to your point Connexus, corporate has 5, 10, 15 different banks. And for each of those banks, they have to have a separate login and a separate set of accounts in different currencies for each of their offices."

The prisoner's dilemma: "If all of the banks tokenize their deposits then this would just get a whole lot easier but now there's this weird prisoner's dilemma of like well if I do that will I be the wallet of choice for this client will my deposits be in there or will it be somebody else."

**Regional Banks' Position:**

Taylor suggests regional banks might benefit from improved correspondent banking: "Maybe they could win if there's a better version of correspondent banking that comes along and if they can get instant settlement too and they can still have some direct consumer and corporate relationship that's a bit of a wedge."

### Tether's Global Strategy

Tether's announcement seeking $200 million for a tokenized gold crypto treasury reveals a multifaceted strategic approach.

**Tokenized Gold Initiative:**

The digital asset treasury would purchase Tether's XAUT token (tokenized gold). The platform has close links with China's Bitmain Technologies, a major Bitcoin mining machine manufacturer, with Tether owning 8.1% of Bitmain.

**Geopolitical Positioning:**

Flament observes divergent regional strategies: "What I find fascinating is almost like tether's approach towards Europe or towards Asia versus actually towards the US." In Europe, regarding MiCA compliance: "We're not going to comply with it. So we're just going to let go." Conversely, in the US: "There are processes being to say, well, we will be actually Genius Compliance and guess what? We're going to hire top-notch people to be able to enable us to do that."

**Massive Fundraising:**

Recent announcements include "this crazy fundraise announcement, which is like, is it 20 billion for like half a trillion valuation or something like that." This represents an "insane amount of money" that positions Tether far beyond a simple stablecoin issuer.

**Vertical Integration:**

Flament describes Tether's expanding empire: "They own pieces of everything and they own pieces of like a whole stack, which goes from actually energy to mining to then, you know, even like things that are much less thought about but like startups in everywhere in every pocket." This creates "an empire that is actually in a way transcending borders but also in a way very very aligned itself with like some very big countries."

**Systemic Risk Concerns:**

Flament raises concentration risk: "A part of me wonders what happens if such a big player has actually a very serious issue and then how much everything could be affected. Because here we're talking about something that's, it's a tentacle. It has actually its arms into so many different things."

**Market Dominance:**

Queathem emphasizes Tether's essential role: "I think it comes down to where the liquidity pools are...Tether trades at a massive premium...the fact that they're not, in most cases, providing any sort of yield is okay because the business model is actually solving a real issue." He concludes: "It's hard to imagine that they don't remain just incredibly dominant in that space."

**Potential Banking Evolution:**

Queathem speculates: "Part of me believes that if they really wanted to, they could actually start to vertically integrate and become somewhat of a global bank, right? Like they provide more stability and access to liquidity than, you know, most institutions around the world at this point."

**Philosophical Consistency:**

Sheffield identifies Tether's coherent long-term vision: "Paulo, at least from what you hear from him, the whole time has maintained that he has a deep belief in Bitcoin and gold as future scarce monetary assets. And Tether holds billions of dollars of Bitcoin. They hold billions of dollars of gold. They've invested in Bitcoin miners. They've invested in gold miners."

The apparent contradiction resolves: "He still has that very kind of Bitcoin native mindset and philosophy, but he also recognizes how much demand exists for dollars and how being able to have a stablecoin product for people who want dollars all over the world is the killer product today." Sheffield suggests they're "playing a multi-decade game where dollars are the product right now. But who knows, 50 years from now, like they have a deep belief in gold, whether it's tokenized or physical and as well as Bitcoin."

**Monetary System Shifts:**

Taylor contextualizes Tether's gold strategy: "Five or 10 years ago, it would have been unthinkable to suggest that the full faith and credit of the United States government was questionable. And since then, it's had a couple of downgrades by ratings agencies of its sovereign debt...Now we actively see central banks buying gold at scale." Against this backdrop, "what Tether's doing...just looks like prudent treasury management on the surface of it. But to your point, there could be a multi-decade game here."

## Key Insights and Implications

### Structural Differences Drive Different Solutions

The fundamental insight that Europe's fragmented financial architecture requires consortium-based approaches rather than unilateral stablecoin issuance challenges assumptions about universal blockchain solutions. The absence of a unified European treasury instrument equivalent to US Treasury bills creates collateral challenges that cannot be solved through technology alone.

### Yield as Multidimensional Strategy

The discussion reveals yield serves three distinct purposes simultaneously:
1. **Customer acquisition** in competitive markets with network effects
2. **Behavioral conditioning** toward on-chain capital management
3. **Geopolitical tool** for currency competition and adoption

This multidimensional nature explains why yield products persist despite regulatory pressure and rate environment changes.

### Control Trumps Absolute Returns

A non-obvious conclusion: users value control and optionality over absolute yield levels. Queathem's insight that users become "addicted to the control" suggests that even in lower-rate environments, the ability to move capital instantly and manage treasury on-demand will prevent significant off-chain migration. This behavioral shift has profound implications for traditional banking.

### Prisoner's Dilemma in Tokenized Deposits

The closed-loop versus open-loop challenge creates a strategic dilemma for banks. Individual banks can create tokenized deposits, but without interbank interoperability, they solve only a fraction of corporate treasury needs. However, full interoperability raises existential questions about deposit retention and wallet preference. This coordination problem may require regulatory intervention similar to open banking mandates.

### Tether's Optionality Strategy

Tether's diversification into gold, mining, energy, and selective regulatory compliance represents sophisticated optionality creation rather than simple business expansion. By maintaining positions across multiple potential future monetary regimes (dollar dominance, gold-backed systems, Bitcoin standard), Tether hedges against various macroeconomic scenarios while maintaining current dollar stablecoin dominance.

### Banks' Underappreciated Advantages

The discussion reveals banks possess unique capabilities in the on-chain world:
- **Credit creation** (versus over-collateralized DeFi lending)
- **Balance sheet capacity** for taking tranches of private credit
- **Regulatory permissions** for activities unavailable to pure crypto entities
- **Established relationships** with corporate treasuries

These advantages suggest banks opposing on-chain innovation advocate against their own interests, as blockchain technology could enhance rather than threaten their core competencies.

### Geopolitical Currency Competition via Stablecoins

The insight that stablecoins enable currency competition through yield and accessibility represents a significant geopolitical development. Europeans using dollar-denominated stablecoins for yield represents de facto dollarization driven by market forces rather than policy. This creates pressure on central banks to enable competitive euro-denominated alternatives or risk monetary sovereignty erosion.

### Timeline Mismatch Between Public and Private Innovation

The 2029 digital euro timeline versus the rapid iteration cycles of private stablecoin issuers and DeFi protocols illustrates a fundamental incompatibility between public procurement processes and technological change velocity. This suggests public infrastructure projects must either adopt more agile methodologies or risk obsolescence before launch.

## Data and Figures

## Definitions and Terminology

### Stablecoin
A cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value relative to a reference asset, typically the US dollar. Stablecoins are backed by reserves (fiat currency, treasury bills, or other assets) held by the issuer.

### Tokenized Deposit
A blockchain-based representation of a traditional bank deposit. Unlike stablecoins issued by non-bank entities, tokenized deposits remain liabilities of regulated banks and maintain existing deposit insurance and regulatory frameworks.

### CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency)
Digital currency issued directly by a central bank. Can be retail (for general public use) or wholesale (for interbank settlement). The digital euro represents a retail CBDC initiative.

### MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation)
European Union regulatory framework for crypto-assets, including stablecoins, establishing licensing requirements, reserve standards, and operational rules for issuers operating in EU markets.

### DeFi (Decentralized Finance)
Financial services built on blockchain technology without traditional intermediaries. DeFi protocols enable lending, borrowing, and trading through smart contracts rather than centralized institutions.

### Yield
Returns generated on capital, expressed as annual percentage yield (APY). In the stablecoin context, yield can derive from underlying reserve returns (e.g., treasury bill interest), lending protocol returns, or token incentives.

### Wholesale CBDC
Central bank digital currency designed for interbank settlement and institutional use rather than retail consumer transactions. Focuses on improving efficiency of large-value payment systems.

### EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)
The runtime environment for smart contracts in Ethereum and compatible blockchains. EVM compatibility allows different blockchain networks to run the same smart contract code.

### Morpho Labs
A DeFi lending protocol that enables optimized interest rates for lenders and borrowers through peer-to-peer matching while maintaining liquidity pool fallbacks.

### Connexus
JPMorgan's blockchain-based payment system enabling cross-border transactions using tokenized deposits (JPM Coin) for institutional clients.

### SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area)
European payment integration initiative enabling euro transfers across participating countries with domestic-like efficiency and cost.

### Correspondent Banking
System where banks maintain accounts with each other to facilitate cross-border payments and currency exchange for their customers.

### Over-collateralized Lending
Lending model requiring borrowers to deposit collateral worth more than the loan amount. Standard in DeFi due to absence of credit assessment and legal recourse mechanisms.

### XAUT
Tether's tokenized gold product, where each token represents ownership of one troy ounce of physical gold held in reserve.

### Regulated Liability Network (RLN)
UK initiative bringing together banks to develop interoperable tokenized deposit infrastructure under regulatory oversight, creating the GBPT (tokenized British pound).

### G-SIB (Global Systemically Important Bank)
Banks designated by international regulators as critical to the global financial system, subject to enhanced supervision and capital requirements.
