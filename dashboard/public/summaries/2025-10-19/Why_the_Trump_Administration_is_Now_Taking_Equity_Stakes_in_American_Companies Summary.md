## Executive Summary

The Trump administration has initiated a novel approach to industrial policy by taking direct equity stakes in American companies, marking a significant departure from traditional government support mechanisms. Unlike the Biden administration's CHIPS Act and Inflation Reduction Act, which primarily used grants and loans with milestone requirements, the Trump administration has converted these arrangements into equity investments in companies like Intel (9.9% stake) and MP Materials (15% stake through the Department of Defense).

This represents a fundamental shift in U.S. government involvement in private enterprise. Historically, government equity stakes in American companies occurred exclusively during bailout situations (1930s banks, 1979-1980 Chrysler, 2008 financial crisis and auto bailouts), with explicit intentions to exit as quickly as possible. The current approach positions the government as a long-term investor seeking both strategic objectives and financial returns.

The legal basis for these arrangements is ambiguous. The CHIPS Act does not explicitly authorize equity stakes, but the administration's legal theory operates on two principles: the Act does not explicitly forbid equity stakes, and there is unclear legal standing for potential challengers to sue. This represents what Peter Harrell, former Biden White House official and current non-resident fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, describes as "novel interpretive approaches to the law."

Key concerns include: the government's role in "picking winners" rather than supporting broad-based competition; potential conflicts between shareholder value maximization and national security objectives; lack of clear statutory framework for managing government investments; and the risk of creating "flabby 1970s European style national champions" rather than competitive, innovative companies.

## Detailed Analysis

### Historical Context of Government Equity Stakes

The United States has maintained a consistent historical pattern regarding government ownership of private companies. Peter Harrell explains: "If you look at the history in the United States of government ownership of private sector companies, it has almost always only been in the context of bailouts."

Three major historical precedents exist:

1. **1930s Banking Crisis**: The Reconstruction Finance Corporation took stakes in approximately 40% of American banks as part of New Deal programs, fundamentally as a bailout mechanism for failing institutions.

2. **1979-1980 Chrysler Bailout**: The government took warrants in Chrysler as part of preventing the automaker's bankruptcy.

3. **2008 Financial Crisis**: Government equity stakes in AIG, financial companies, and automakers were explicitly temporary measures with clear exit strategies. Harrell notes: "The Treasury Department exited most of those positions within a couple of years, certainly as soon as commercially feasible."

In all historical cases, the government's stated objective was ownership "for as short a time as possible." The current Trump administration approach fundamentally differs by positioning the government as a long-term investor seeking both strategic benefits and financial upside.

### The Intel Deal Structure

The Intel arrangement represents a conversion of the Biden-era CHIPS Act grant structure into an equity investment:

**Original CHIPS Act Structure**: The Commerce Department planned to distribute approximately $8 billion to Intel over multiple years, with payments contingent on meeting specific milestones for building four fabrication facilities (fabs) in Ohio, Arizona, New Mexico, and Oregon.

**Trump Administration Restructuring**: 
- The government transferred just under $6 billion in cash upfront to Intel
- Received a 9.9% equity stake in return
- Intel was relieved of its milestone obligations for fab construction
- The U.S. Department of Commerce is now listed as a top shareholder on Bloomberg's HDS function

**Rationale**: Harrell explains the administration's theory: "By injecting capital into Intel, by taking an equity stake in Intel, we, the U.S. Government, are sending a very strong signal of support to Intel. Both gives them some capital up front, but it also gives them this very strong signal of support that will help Intel go around and get customers, get other investors to come in."

**Corporate Governance Provisions**: According to SEC filings, the government has agreed to vote its shares according to board recommendations, except in major transactions like change-of-control situations. Additionally, a "poison pill" provision prevents Intel from splitting its fab manufacturing and chip design operations.

**Market Performance**: The equity stake has appreciated approximately 60% since the deal was announced, representing a successful trade for the government thus far.

### The MP Materials Deal

The MP Materials arrangement involves rare earth mineral mining and processing, structured through the Department of Defense:

**Structure**: DOD contracted with MP Materials to scale up operations in California (mining) and California/Texas (processing facilities to produce rare earth magnets). In exchange, MP granted the government a 15% equity stake, making the Defense Department the largest shareholder.

**Key Provisions**:
- Government serves as guaranteed purchaser of magnets
- Guaranteed profit margins for MP Materials
- Harrell characterizes it as "sort of a no-lose business proposition" for private investors

**Strategic Context**: China dominates rare earth magnet production due to scale, engineering expertise, and lower environmental regulations. Harrell states: "China is the low cost producer of rare earth magnets. It just is." Any U.S. production will require subsidies, either direct (like the MP deal) or indirect (tariffs).

**Complexity**: Harrell and colleague Arnab Dada wrote a 4,000-word analysis of this deal, indicating its structural complexity compared to traditional government contracts.

### Legal Authority and Basis

The legal foundation for these equity arrangements remains contested and ambiguous:

**CHIPS Act Authority**: The CHIPS Act does not explicitly authorize equity stakes in companies. It was designed as a grant and loan program to subsidize semiconductor manufacturing.

**Administration's Legal Theory**: Harrell summarizes: "I think the Trump administration's legal theory here basically boils down to two things. First is, well, the CHIPS Act may not say we can take an equity stake, but it doesn't forbid us from taking an equity stake. So why not? And then thing two on their legal theory is who's going to sue us anyway?"

**Standing to Sue**: Intel will not challenge a deal it voluntarily entered. Other potential challengers (competitors like Samsung U.S. or AMD) may lack clear legal standing or may avoid antagonizing an administration that could offer them similar arrangements in the future.

**Expansion of Authority**: The CHIPS office at the Commerce Department recently issued a notice for a new semiconductor R&D grant program explicitly stating "that bidders for these grants may be expected to offer the government warrants or equity as a piece of it."

**Broader Application**: Secretary Lutnick has suggested defense contractors should also provide equity stakes, indicating the administration's intention to expand this model across sectors.

### Corporate Governance Implications

The equity stakes create unprecedented corporate governance questions without clear statutory guidance:

**Lack of Federal Framework**: Harrell notes: "There isn't really any federal set of regulations or laws about how the government manage its investments and what its role in corporate governance should be. So we're sort of seeing ad hoc approaches as the government does these deals."

**Intel-Specific Arrangements**: The government agreed to vote shares according to board recommendations (except for major transactions), effectively giving the board control over 9.9% of shares. Harrell observes: "That's a great deal for the board, because actually now the board of Intel knows it has 10 percent or 9.9 percent of the shares to do whatever it wants."

**Variability Across Deals**: Each arrangement has unique governance provisions, creating inconsistency and uncertainty about future government involvement in corporate management.

**Potential for Political Interference**: The administration has demonstrated willingness to comment on individual executives and corporate decisions. Harrell predicts: "I think the board is clearly probably going to feel some pressure that not just the government, but also the government and its largest shareholder, one of its largest shareholders, are going to be prodding it to do things that might be in what they see as the Commerce Department or the country's interest, even if those aren't in shareholder interest."

**Taxation Analogy**: Joe Weisenthal offers a conceptual framework: with a 21% corporate tax rate, "the US government already owns about a fifth of every private company in America" through taxation. However, this is a passive stake. The new equity arrangements create potential for active, specific involvement in individual company management beyond traditional regulatory frameworks.

### Comparison with Chinese Industrial Policy

The Trump administration's approach shows both similarities and differences with Chinese state capitalism:

**Similarities**:
- Direct government equity stakes in strategic companies
- Focus on national security and economic security objectives
- Willingness to subsidize domestic production against lower-cost foreign competition
- Harrell acknowledges: "There is kind of an element here, right? We're looking a little bit like state capitalism with American characteristics."

**Differences**:

1. **Level of Government Involvement**: In China, much equity investment occurs at the provincial level through state-owned enterprises (SOEs), with central government focusing more on grants and R&D programs.

2. **Competition Strategy**: China "does tend to bet on multiple companies." The Chinese EV sector succeeded because "you had lots of provinces investing in lots of companies, plus a tremendous amount of central government support on the demand side, as well as on the supply side." This created "dozens of EV companies there out in the marketplace, battling every week to build better technology."

3. **U.S. Risk**: The current U.S. approach risks creating single "national champions" rather than competitive ecosystems. Harrell warns against backing "flabby 1970s European style national champions, which, you know, didn't turn out too well in the past."

**Ideological Scrambling**: The approach has created unusual political alignments, with Bernie Sanders praising the Intel deal as "a great return for the American people" while some Republicans characterized it as "the end of capitalism."

### Market Impact and Investment Dynamics

The equity stakes have created new market dynamics and investment considerations:

**Stock Performance**: Intel, MP Materials, and other companies with government stakes have experienced significant appreciation. This has led to a "copycat trade" phenomenon where private investors seek to align with government positions.

**Investment Logic**: Private investors reason that the government will want to support its investments and ensure returns, creating an implicit backstop or support mechanism for these companies.

**Bloomberg Terminal Visibility**: The U.S. Department of Commerce now appears as a listed top shareholder on Bloomberg terminals, providing unprecedented transparency into government investment positions.

**Crowding-In Effect**: The Intel deal attracted additional investors, including NVIDIA, suggesting the government stake may serve as a positive signal to other market participants.

**Risk Considerations**: Despite market enthusiasm, fundamental questions remain about whether these companies can execute on their strategic objectives. For Intel specifically, Harrell identifies core challenges: "Can it do the engineering to build advanced chips? Like that's problem number one" and "are there going to be customers to buy Intel's chips?"

## Key Insights and Implications

### Strategic Picking of Winners

The equity approach represents explicit government selection of specific companies rather than broad-based support:

**MP Materials Example**: Harrell explains: "MP is one of it's not the only company in the U.S. that is trying to get rare earths mining and manufacturing going again. There are a number of other companies that are doing this with mining operations elsewhere in the U.S." Additionally, some companies are developing alternative materials that could eliminate rare earth requirements entirely. By guaranteeing MP's profitability, "the government is saying, you know what, we're guaranteeing that MP is going to make the money here without actually knowing, is MP like the most cost efficient, the best technological bet?"

**Contrast with Broader Approaches**: Tax credits in the CHIPS Act (25% investment tax credit for fab construction) represent more neutral, market-based approaches that allow multiple competitors to benefit based on their own commercial decisions.

### Fundamental Tension Between Objectives

A core conflict exists between maximizing shareholder value and achieving national security objectives:

**Intel's Counterfactual**: Had Intel pursued a "fabless" strategy like NVIDIA (focusing on chip design while outsourcing manufacturing to TSMC), the company might be worth significantly more today. The national security imperative to maintain U.S. manufacturing capacity may have reduced Intel's commercial value.

**Shadow Mandate**: Companies with government equity stakes may operate under implicit obligations to prioritize national interests over pure profit maximization, creating uncertainty for other shareholders about corporate decision-making.

**Chinese Model Comparison**: In China, the compromise appears to be high innovation and production volume with lower profit expectations. This model's applicability to the U.S. corporate structure remains unclear.

### Lack of Institutional Framework

The absence of statutory guidance creates significant risks:

**Ad Hoc Governance**: Each deal has unique terms negotiated individually, creating inconsistency and unpredictability for future arrangements.

**Political Vulnerability**: Without clear legal frameworks, these arrangements could shift dramatically with each administration, creating instability for long-term corporate planning.

**Potential for Expansion**: The administration has indicated interest in expanding equity requirements to defense contractors and other sectors, potentially without corresponding strategic vision. Harrell warns: "I'm a little worried that we're going to see more of this. And then they'll have to try to back end some strategic vision after they have a number of these deals in the latter."

### Alternative Approaches

Several alternative models could achieve similar objectives with different trade-offs:

**Jigar Shah's LPO Model**: The Loan Programs Office approach of "saying yes to everybody" who meets criteria allows multiple bets on different technologies and companies, fostering competition and innovation.

**Export Test**: Developing economy models sometimes use export success as a metric for continued support, providing market-based validation of competitiveness.

**Demand-Side Support**: The MP Materials deal includes guaranteed government purchases, which Harrell views as potentially more effective than pure supply-side subsidies. However, the Intel deal lacks such provisions.

**Broader Tax Incentives**: The CHIPS Act's 25% investment tax credit represents a more neutral approach that supports any qualifying investment without picking specific winners.

### Foreign Relations Implications

Intel has warned that government ownership could create complications:

**Regulatory Concerns**: Foreign governments may impose additional regulations or restrictions on companies with significant U.S. government ownership.

**Competitive Disadvantages**: International customers or partners may hesitate to work with companies perceived as instruments of U.S. government policy.

**Reciprocal Actions**: Other nations may respond with similar interventionist policies, potentially fragmenting global markets.
