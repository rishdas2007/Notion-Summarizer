## Executive Summary

The Trump administration has initiated a novel approach to industrial policy by taking direct equity stakes in American companies, marking a significant departure from traditional government support mechanisms. Unlike the Biden administration's CHIPS Act and Inflation Reduction Act, which primarily used grants and loans with milestone requirements, the Trump administration has converted these arrangements into equity investments in companies like Intel (9.9% stake) and MP Materials (15% stake through the Department of Defense).

This represents a fundamental shift in U.S. government involvement in private enterprise. Historically, government equity stakes in American companies occurred exclusively during bailout situations (1930s banks, 1979-1980 Chrysler, 2008 financial crisis and auto bailouts), with explicit intentions to exit as quickly as possible. The current approach positions the government as a long-term investor seeking both strategic national security objectives and financial returns.

The legal basis for these arrangements is ambiguous. The CHIPS Act does not explicitly authorize equity stakes, but the administration's legal theory operates on two principles: the Act does not explicitly forbid equity stakes, and there is unclear legal standing for potential challengers to sue. This represents what Peter Harrell, former Biden White House official and current non-resident fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, characterizes as "novel interpretive approaches to the law."

Key concerns include: the government's role in picking winners rather than supporting broad-based competition; potential conflicts between shareholder value maximization and national security objectives; lack of clear statutory framework for managing government investments; and the precedent this sets for future administrations to rapidly shift corporate strategy through equity influence rather than traditional regulatory or legislative processes.

## Detailed Analysis

### Historical Context of Government Equity Stakes

The United States has maintained a consistent historical pattern regarding government ownership of private companies: equity stakes have been taken exclusively in bailout contexts. Peter Harrell explains: "If you look at the history in the United States of government ownership of private sector companies, it has almost always only been in the context of bailouts."

Three major historical precedents exist:

1. **1930s Banking Crisis**: The Reconstruction Finance Corporation took stakes in approximately 40% of American banks as part of New Deal programs responding to widespread bank failures.

2. **1979-1980 Chrysler Bailout**: As Chrysler faced bankruptcy, the government took warrants in the company as part of the rescue package.

3. **2008 Financial Crisis**: Government equity positions in AIG, financial institutions, and automakers were taken as emergency measures, with explicit Treasury Department guidance emphasizing temporary ownership.

In all cases, the government's stated objective was to exit these positions "as short a time as possible" and "certainly as soon as commercially feasible." Treasury exited most 2008 positions within a couple of years.

Harrell contrasts this with current policy: "I think what the Trump administration is doing now is really quite different, where they seem to be seeing themselves, seeing the U.S. Government as a long-term investor in a set of sectors, in a set of companies where they think having that government capital as a long-term investor will help, A, strengthen the company and the sector, and B, potentially give some upside to the U.S. Government."

### The Intel Deal Structure

The Intel arrangement represents a conversion of existing CHIPS Act commitments into equity ownership. Under the Biden administration, Intel received a commitment for approximately $8 billion in grants, structured to be distributed over multiple years as Intel met specific milestones for building four fabrication facilities (fabs) in Ohio, Arizona, New Mexico, and Oregon.

The Trump administration restructured this arrangement:

- **Equity Stake**: The government received a 9.9% equity position in Intel
- **Cash Transfer**: Just under $6 billion in previously unallocated grant money was transferred to Intel immediately
- **Milestone Relief**: Intel was relieved of its legal obligations to meet the previously agreed construction milestones
- **Golden Share**: The government obtained special voting rights similar to those in the Nippon Steel/U.S. Steel deal

According to SEC filings, the government agreed to vote its shares according to board recommendations except in major transactions involving change of control. This arrangement effectively gives Intel's board control over 9.9% of shares for most purposes.

**Market Performance**: The Intel stock price has increased significantly since the deal announcement, with the government's stake reportedly up approximately 60% in value. Additional validation came when NVIDIA announced it would also invest in Intel.

**Strategic Rationale**: The administration's theory, as Harrell explains, is that "by injecting capital into Intel, by taking an equity stake in Intel, we, the U.S. Government, are sending a very strong signal of support to Intel. Both gives them some capital up front, but it also gives them this very strong signal of support that will help Intel go around and get customers, get other investors to come in."

### The MP Materials Deal

MP Materials operates a rare earth mining facility in California and is developing processing capabilities in California and Texas to produce rare earth magnets used in various industrial applications. The deal structure is notably complex:

- **Equity Stake**: The Department of Defense received a 15% stake, making it the largest shareholder
- **Contract Structure**: DOD contracted with MP to scale up mining and processing operations
- **Guaranteed Purchases**: The government committed to purchasing MP's output
- **Profit Guarantees**: The deal includes guaranteed profit margins for MP

Harrell notes: "I actually kind of get why private investors are crowding into MP, because it's sort of a no-lose business proposition at this point."

**Competitive Context**: China dominates rare earth magnet production due to scale, engineering expertise, and lower environmental regulations. Harrell states: "China is the low cost producer of rare earth magnets. It just is. It has the scale and it has multiple companies that do it... If we as the United States do not want to be dependent on China for rare earth magnets, we are going to have, at least in the near and midterm, to pay more for those magnets."

The subsidy must come either through direct government support (as in the MP deal) or indirect protection through tariffs. This raises fundamental questions about whether national security and economic security needs justify paying above-market prices for domestic production.

### Legal Authority and Basis

The legal foundation for these equity arrangements is contested and unclear. The CHIPS Act, which authorized the original Intel grants, contains no explicit provision for equity stakes. Harrell outlines the administration's legal theory:

"I think the Trump administration's legal theory here basically boils down to two things. First is, well, the CHIPS Act may not say we can take an equity stake, but it doesn't forbid us from taking an equity stake. So why not? And then thing two on their legal theory is who's going to sue us anyway?"

**Standing Issues**: Intel will not challenge the deal it agreed to. Other potential challengers (competitors like Samsung U.S. or AMD) face unclear legal standing and may be reluctant to antagonize an administration that could offer them similar arrangements in the future.

**Statutory Interpretation**: The administration interprets flexible grant authority as permitting equity components even though the statute was "clearly intended as a grant authority, not an equity authority." The absence of explicit prohibition is treated as implicit permission.

**Expansion Plans**: The Commerce Department's CHIPS office recently issued a notice for a new semiconductor R&D grant program stating that "bidders for these grants may be expected to offer the government warrants or equity as a piece of it," indicating systematic expansion of this approach.

### Corporate Governance Implications

The government's role as shareholder raises unprecedented corporate governance questions. Harrell expresses concern: "There isn't really any federal set of regulations or laws about how the government manage its investments and what its role in corporate governance should be. So we're sort of seeing ad hoc approaches as the government does these deals."

**Intel Governance Arrangements**:
- Government votes shares according to board recommendations (except for change-of-control transactions)
- This gives the board effective control over 9.9% of votes
- A poison pill provision prevents Intel from splitting its fab manufacturing and chip design operations
- The U.S. Department of Commerce is now listed as a top shareholder on Bloomberg's HDS function

**Potential Conflicts**: Tracy Alloway raises a fundamental tension: "If I think about companies in the US, the goal is to maximize shareholder value. And that's been pretty explicit over time. But now you're adding in, you know, strategic ambitions and the public good aspect."

Intel's strategic decisions may be constrained by national security considerations. Joe Weisenthal notes that Intel might be worth more today if it had become "fabless" like NVIDIA (whose market cap is approximately 40 times larger) and outsourced all chip production to TSMC. The company may be bearing an implicit cost from its national security obligations.

**Political Influence**: Harrell warns: "This is a government that wants to get involved in day-to corporate operations. We see the president talking about individual executives at individual companies, and a commerce secretary is very clear he thinks companies should be doing things in the public interest."

### Comparison with Chinese Industrial Policy

The approach bears resemblance to Chinese state capitalism while maintaining some distinctions. Harrell acknowledges: "There is kind of an element here, right? We're looking a little bit like state capitalism with American characteristics."

**Key Differences**:

1. **Level of Government**: In China, much equity investment occurs at the provincial level through provincial SOEs, with central government focusing more on grants and R&D programs.

2. **Competition**: China often backs multiple companies within sectors. The successful EV sector resulted from "lots of provinces investing in lots of companies, plus a tremendous amount of central government support on the demand side, as well as on the supply side." This created "dozens of EV companies there out in the marketplace, battling every week to build better technology and to sell it to customers."

3. **Market Structure**: Chinese state capitalism maintains competitive dynamics that spur innovation, avoiding the pitfalls of "flabby 1970s European style national champions."

**Winner-Picking Concerns**: The U.S. approach concentrates support on specific companies (Intel for semiconductors, MP for rare earths) rather than supporting multiple competitors. Harrell notes: "Here, rather than sort of saying, you know what, we have a program, we're giving a tax incentive to anybody who qualifies to kind of let all of these ideas flourish. The government is saying, you know what, we're guaranteeing that MP is going to make the money here without actually knowing, is MP like the most cost efficient, the best technological bet?"

### Market Impact and Investment Dynamics

The equity stakes have generated significant market interest and raised questions about investment strategy alignment.

**Stock Performance**: Intel, MP Materials, and at least one other company with government stakes have performed well. This has prompted private investors to consider following the government's positions, reasoning that the government will want to support its investments and see returns.

**Signaling Effects**: Government equity stakes may function as powerful market signals, attracting other investors and customers. The NVIDIA investment in Intel following the government stake provides some evidence for this mechanism.

**ETF Speculation**: There is discussion of potential ETFs tracking government equity positions, allowing retail investors to replicate the government's portfolio.

**Competitive Dynamics**: Companies without government backing may face disadvantages. The government's 15% stake in MP Materials and guaranteed purchase agreements create "a no-lose business proposition" that competitors cannot match without similar support.

**Future Expansion**: Secretary Lutnick has discussed potentially requiring defense contractors to provide equity stakes. The administration appears to be "drastically broadening out its views of what sectors the government should get involved in," according to Harrell, who worries "they are probably broadening it out ahead of any strategic vision."

## Key Insights and Implications

1. **Precedent for Rapid Policy Shifts**: Unlike regulatory or legislative changes that require substantial process, equity stakes could enable future administrations to quickly alter their relationship with specific companies. This creates potential for significant policy volatility across administrations.

2. **Implicit Taxation Through Equity**: Joe Weisenthal offers a novel perspective: with a 21% corporate tax rate, "the US government already owns about a fifth of every private company in America" through taxation. The difference is that traditional taxation represents "a very passive equity stake," while direct equity ownership enables "activist involvement in the private sector beyond the sort of traditional regulatory or legal environment."

3. **National Security vs. Shareholder Value**: Companies receiving government equity face potential conflicts between maximizing shareholder returns and fulfilling national security objectives. Intel's decision to remain in fab manufacturing rather than becoming fabless may represent an implicit cost of this relationship.

4. **Absence of Statutory Framework**: The lack of clear legal authority and governance standards for government equity investments creates uncertainty and potential for inconsistent application across deals and administrations.

5. **Winner-Picking Risks**: Concentrating support on specific companies (Intel, MP Materials) rather than supporting broad-based competition through neutral mechanisms (tax credits, multiple grants) risks backing companies that may not be the most innovative or cost-efficient solutions.

6. **Engineering Capability Questions**: Both Intel and MP Materials face fundamental questions about technical execution capability. For Intel, the core challenge is "can it do the engineering to build advanced chips?" For MP, the question is whether rare earth refining can be done at competitive costs compared to Chinese producers.

7. **Market Creation vs. Market Participation**: In sectors where the government creates artificial markets through subsidies or protection (rare earths), equity stakes may be more justifiable as the government is enabling otherwise non-viable businesses. In competitive sectors (semiconductors), the rationale is weaker.

8. **Optics vs. Substance**: Government equity stakes may be politically more palatable than raising corporate taxes or expanding regulation, even if the economic effect is similar. Framing government involvement as "creating shareholder value for taxpayers" plays differently than "raising taxes."

9. **Limited Firepower**: The government has approximately $10 billion in unallocated CHIPS Act funding and substantial Loan Programs Office (LPO) lending capacity, but expansion beyond current levels would likely require new Congressional appropriations—unless the administration continues its flexible interpretation of existing authorities.

10. **Foreign Relations Complications**: Intel has warned that having the U.S. government as a major shareholder could create problems abroad, potentially leading to additional regulations, obligations, or restrictions in foreign markets.
