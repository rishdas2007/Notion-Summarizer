## Executive Summary

The Trump administration has introduced a novel approach to industrial policy by taking direct equity stakes in American companies, specifically Intel and MP Materials. This represents a significant departure from historical U.S. government practice, where equity ownership occurred almost exclusively in bailout scenarios (e.g., 1930s bank failures, 1979-1980 Chrysler bailout, 2008 financial crisis). The government has acquired a 9.9% stake in Intel and a 15% stake in MP Materials, making the U.S. Department of Commerce and Department of Defense major shareholders in these publicly-traded companies.

The Intel deal converted approximately $6 billion in unspent CHIPS Act grants into an equity purchase, while simultaneously relieving Intel of previously agreed-upon milestone obligations for building semiconductor fabrication facilities. The MP Materials arrangement involves the Department of Defense contracting for rare earth mining and processing capacity expansion in exchange for equity ownership.

This approach differs fundamentally from the Biden administration's industrial policy, which relied on grants and loans tied to specific milestones. The Trump administration's strategy emphasizes sending "strong signals of support" to companies and betting on their long-term success rather than enforcing specific performance requirements. The legal authority for these equity stakes remains ambiguous, as the CHIPS Act does not explicitly authorize equity ownership, though it also does not prohibit it. The administration's interpretation relies on flexible grant authority and the practical reality that no party with standing is likely to challenge the arrangement.

## Detailed Analysis

### Historical Context: Government Support Without Equity

Peter Harrell, a non-resident fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and former Biden White House official, explains that government equity ownership in private U.S. companies has been "very, very unusual in American history." Historically, such ownership occurred "almost always only been in the context of bailouts."

Key historical examples include:

- **1930s**: The Reconstruction Finance Corporation took stakes in approximately 40% of American banks during the Great Depression as part of New Deal bailout programs
- **1979-1980**: The government took warrants in Chrysler as part of bankruptcy bailout proceedings
- **2008 Financial Crisis**: Equity stakes in AIG, financial companies, and automakers as part of emergency bailouts

In all these cases, the government made clear its intention to hold equity "for as short a time as possible" and exited positions "within a couple of years, certainly as soon as commercially feasible."

The Biden administration's industrial policy, including the CHIPS Act and support for rare earth processing, operated through grants and loans without equity components. The public return was conceptualized as the strategic benefit of domestic manufacturing capacity—chip production and rare earth processing in the United States—rather than financial returns to taxpayers.

### The New Approach: Direct Equity Stakes

The Trump administration has fundamentally reframed government industrial support by positioning "the U.S. Government as a long-term investor in a set of sectors, in a set of companies." This approach aims to:

1. Strengthen companies and sectors through capital injection
2. Provide potential upside to the U.S. government
3. Send strong market signals that attract additional private investment
4. Create alignment between government interests and company success

The market has responded positively to these arrangements. Intel and MP Materials shares have "done very well," with the government's Intel stake reportedly up approximately 60% in value. This has created what some observers describe as a "trade" opportunity—investors positioning themselves alongside government holdings on the assumption that the government will support its investments.

Tracy Alloway notes that the U.S. Department of Commerce now appears as a top shareholder in Bloomberg's HDS function for Intel, creating the unusual situation of government portfolio management of publicly-traded equities.

### Structure of the Intel Deal

The Intel arrangement represents a conversion of existing CHIPS Act commitments into equity ownership:

**Original Biden-Era Structure:**
- Approximately $8 billion in grants to be distributed over multiple years
- Payments tied to specific milestones for building four sets of fabrication facilities in Ohio, Arizona, New Mexico, and Oregon
- 15% subsidy of Intel's total construction costs
- Legally binding obligations to complete facility construction

**Trump Administration Restructuring:**
- Transfer of just under $6 billion in unspent grant funds to Intel as immediate cash
- Acquisition of 9.9% equity stake in Intel
- Relief from previous milestone obligations for fab construction
- Conversion from performance-based grant to equity investment

According to SEC filings, "Intel is now, as we discussed, relieved of those milestone obligations." The administration's theory is that capital injection combined with the "very strong signal of support" will help Intel "go around and get customers, get other investors to come in." NVIDIA's subsequent investment in Intel provides some evidence for this theory.

One exception to the lack of guaranteed customers: a small Defense Department component of the deal involves building "highly secure chips for the Pentagon," which does provide a guaranteed end customer, though this represents a minor portion of the overall arrangement.

### Structure of the MP Materials Deal

The MP Materials deal, which Harrell describes as "extremely complicated," involves:

- Department of Defense contract with MP Materials to scale up rare earth mining operations in California
- Expansion of processing facilities in both California and Texas to convert rare earths into magnets for industrial applications
- 15% equity stake granted to the government in exchange for the contract
- Department of Defense becoming the largest shareholder in MP Materials
- Unlike Intel, this deal includes an order book—the government commits to purchasing output, providing guaranteed demand

The inclusion of guaranteed government purchases represents a more comprehensive industrial policy approach, addressing both supply-side capacity (through capital) and demand-side certainty (through committed purchases).

### Shift from Milestone-Based to Investment-Based Support

The fundamental philosophical shift involves moving from "here are things we want you to do, we will pay you for milestones" to "we are going to bet on you as a company and hope that our bet on you helps you succeed over time."

**Previous Approach (Biden Administration):**
- Specific, measurable milestones
- Phased payment releases tied to progress
- Legal obligations to complete agreed-upon projects
- Focus on ensuring taxpayer money achieves stated objectives
- Public benefit measured by capacity creation

**Current Approach (Trump Administration):**
- Upfront capital transfer
- Equity ownership providing financial upside potential
- Reduced or eliminated milestone requirements
- Market signaling to attract private capital
- Success measured by company performance and stock appreciation

This represents what some observers have called "more activist industrial policy or state interventionist industrial policy." The ideological implications have created unusual political alignments, with Bernie Sanders praising the Intel deal as "a great return for the American people" while some Republicans characterized it as "the end of capitalism."

### Legal Authority and Interpretation

The legal foundation for these equity arrangements remains contested and ambiguous. Tracy Alloway's question—"What legal authority does the Trump administration actually have to do this?"—highlights a significant uncertainty.

Harrell explains the administration's legal theory as resting on two pillars:

1. **Permissive Interpretation**: "The CHIPS Act may not say we can take an equity stake, but it doesn't forbid us from taking an equity stake. So why not?"

2. **Practical Immunity**: "Who's going to sue us anyway? I mean, Intel's not going to sue us, right? They just agreed to this deal. And it's not clear that anyone else really has legal standing to go into court to sue over this."

The CHIPS Act provides "very flexible grant authority" that was "clearly intended as a grant authority, not an equity authority." However, the statutory language "doesn't say you cannot take equity as a part of this. It just says you can give grants." The administration has interpreted this silence as authorization.

Harrell characterizes this as representative of "much of the Trump administration"—"a lot of novel interpretive approaches to the law" that push boundaries of executive authority. The Defense Production Act was mentioned as a potential alternative legal foundation, though Harrell does not confirm its use in these specific deals.

### Risks and Challenges

#### Intel-Specific Risks

Harrell characterizes the Intel investment as "a very high risk bet" due to fundamental questions about the company's capabilities:

**Strategic Missteps:**
- 2007 decision not to produce chips for the iPhone—described as a "huge strategic misstep"
- Mid-2010s decision against investing in EUV (extreme ultraviolet) lithography, the advanced technology TSMC uses to manufacture "hands down, the world's most advanced chips"
- Years of playing "catch-up game" with "very deep doubts across the industry about whether Intel can actually do this catch-up game"

**Core Problems:**
Intel's challenges are not primarily financial. As a "$100 billion market cap company" with approximately $10 billion in cash and access to debt markets, capital availability is not the binding constraint. The fundamental issues are:

1. **Engineering Capacity**: "Can it do the engineering to build advanced chips? Like that's problem number one."
2. **Customer Acquisition**: "Are there going to be customers to buy Intel's chips?"

These problems are "totally linked because if it can't do the engineering, there won't be customers. And if it can't do the engineering, there probably will be customers."

#### Government Picking Winners

The Intel deal represents explicit government selection of a "champion company." The government is "placing a huge bet on Intel and not on TSMC and not on, you know, startup semiconductor companies that might actually be more innovative in this space."

This contradicts historical U.S. policy: "Historically, we've kind of said we want to let companies go out and compete in the marketplace. And we're not going to put a very heavy thumb on the scale in favor of one particular kind of champion company."

The current approach involves the government "clearly" putting "a thumb on the scale here for Intel" with the hope this "helps them get customers and engineers and the like."

#### Execution Risk Beyond Capital

The conversation highlights that both Intel and MP Materials face execution challenges that capital alone cannot solve:

**Intel**: The question is not whether they can afford to build fabs, but whether they can execute the engineering required to produce competitive advanced semiconductors. Past strategic choices (iPhone chips, EUV lithography) suggest potential organizational or technical limitations beyond funding.

**MP Materials**: While the California mine is "very rich in rare earths," the critical challenge is "whether you can refine these metals at a cost competitive price, especially compared to the Chinese who have invested a ton of this and are clearly far and away the leader in the most advanced infrastructure."

China's dominance in rare earth processing stems from extensive infrastructure investment and accumulated expertise, not merely access to raw materials. The U.S. faces a knowledge and capability gap that capital investment may not bridge.

## Key Insights and Implications

1. **Paradigm Shift in Industrial Policy**: The move from milestone-based grants to equity ownership represents a fundamental reconceptualization of government's role in industrial development, positioning the state as a long-term investor rather than a conditional supporter.

2. **Legal Ambiguity as Strategy**: The administration's approach relies on exploiting statutory silence and the practical absence of parties with standing to challenge the arrangements, suggesting a broader pattern of executive authority expansion through interpretive flexibility.

3. **Market Signaling vs. Operational Control**: The strategy prioritizes sending confidence signals to markets and potential investors over direct operational oversight or performance requirements, betting that capital and credibility can substitute for milestone enforcement.

4. **Misalignment Between Capital and Capability**: Both deals involve companies whose primary challenges are technical execution and competitive positioning rather than access to capital, raising questions about whether equity investment addresses root problems.

5. **Political Realignment**: The policy has created unusual ideological crosscurrents, with progressive politicians praising government ownership while some conservatives criticize it, suggesting traditional political categories may not adequately capture emerging debates about state economic intervention.

6. **Taxpayer Return vs. Strategic Benefit**: The shift toward equity ownership reframes the public interest from strategic capacity (domestic chip production, rare earth processing) to financial returns, potentially creating tension between national security objectives and portfolio performance.

7. **Government as Market Participant**: The visible presence of the Department of Commerce as a major shareholder in publicly-traded companies creates novel dynamics, including potential "meme stock" effects and investor strategies based on front-running government positions.

8. **Champion Company Risk**: Concentrating support on specific companies (Intel over TSMC or startups) creates path dependency and may foreclose more innovative or effective alternatives, with the government's reputation and capital now tied to specific corporate outcomes.

## Definitions and Terminology

**CHIPS Act**: Legislation providing funding for domestic semiconductor manufacturing capacity, historically structured as grants and loans tied to facility construction milestones.

**EUV Lithography**: Extreme ultraviolet lithography, an advanced chip manufacturing technology that enables production of the most sophisticated semiconductors. TSMC's adoption of this technology while Intel declined represents a key competitive divergence.

**Fabs**: Semiconductor fabrication facilities where chips are manufactured. Building fabs requires enormous capital investment and advanced technical capabilities.

**Rare Earths**: A group of 17 metallic elements critical for various industrial applications, particularly magnets used in electronics and defense systems. China dominates global rare earth processing despite the elements being geologically widespread.

**Warrants**: Financial instruments that give the holder the right to purchase equity at a specified price, historically used in government bailouts to provide potential upside if rescued companies recover.

**Milestone Obligations**: Specific, measurable performance requirements tied to grant disbursements, ensuring recipients complete agreed-upon projects before receiving full funding.

**Defense Production Act**: Federal law granting the president broad authority to direct private industry for national defense purposes, mentioned as a potential legal foundation for equity arrangements though not confirmed as the basis for these specific deals.

**HDS Function**: Bloomberg terminal function displaying major shareholders in publicly-traded companies, now showing the U.S. Department of Commerce as a top Intel shareholder.

On historical government equity ownership: "If you look at the history in the United States of government ownership of private sector companies, it has almost always only been in the context of bailouts."

On the new approach: "I think what the Trump administration is doing now is really quite different, where they seem to be seeing themselves, seeing the U.S. Government as a long-term investor in a set of sectors, in a set of companies."

On Intel's challenges: "Can it do the engineering to build advanced chips? Like that's problem number one."

On government picking winners: "We definitely have an instance here of the government picking a winner, right? They are placing a huge bet on Intel and not on TSMC and not on, you know, startup semiconductor companies that might actually be more innovative in this space."

On legal authority: "I think the Trump administration's legal theory here basically boils down to two things. First is, well, the CHIPS Act may not say we can take an equity stake, but it doesn't forbid us from taking an equity stake. So why not? And then thing two on their legal theory is who's going to sue us anyway?"
