## Executive Summary

This podcast episode features Bill Ackman, founder and CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management, in conversation with hosts Michael Mauboussin and Tano Santos. Ackman traces his investment career from early formative experiences through the founding of Gotham Partners, his controversial activist short campaigns against Farmer Mac and MBIA, and the evolution of Pershing Square into a $30 billion permanent capital vehicle.

**Main Themes:**

1. **Independent Decision-Making**: A near-death experience at age 16 taught Ackman to listen carefully but make his own decisions, a principle that has guided his career.

2. **Evolution Through Crisis**: Ackman's investment approach evolved through three distinct eras at Pershing Square, with the transition to permanent capital in 2018 marking a transformational period that enabled a 24% net annual return.

3. **Investment Philosophy**: Focus on "durable moats"â€”businesses with sustainable competitive advantages, preferably capital-light "royalty collecting" models with network effects and recurring revenue streams.

4. **Activist Advantage**: Ackman's competitive edge comes from acquiring control benefits at a discount by buying undervalued businesses during periods of disappointment and using activist influence to drive change.

5. **Permanent Capital Benefits**: The shift to permanent capital eliminated the distraction of investor relations, prevented forced selling during market stress, and allowed front-footed capital deployment during crises.

## Detailed Analysis

### Formative Experiences and Early Independence

Ackman recounts a pivotal childhood experience at age 16 that shaped his approach to decision-making. While changing a tire on his father's car, he consulted the manual which specified placing the car on a level surface. His father dismissed this requirement, but Ackman proceeded anyway. The car nearly fell off the jack while his legs were underneath, narrowly avoiding serious injury.

Ackman reflects: "My takeaway from the whole experience was I'm always going to listen, but I'm going to make my own decisions because it's my life that I have on the line. And I've always lived that way." This principle of independent thinking while remaining open to input became foundational to his investment approach.

### Harvard Education and Skill Development

Ackman identifies three critical skills developed during his Harvard undergraduate years:

**Writing**: He emphasizes that "being able to articulate your thoughts, one of the best tests as to whether you really understand something is put it down on a piece of paper. It can make sense in your mind. And then if you put it down on a piece of paper, and there's no clarity to it, then there are gaps in your understanding."

**Rowing**: The sport taught him that "the limits of your physical, mental limits are much greater than you believe" and provided persistence training valuable for dealing with failure in investing.

**Sales Experience**: Working for Harvard Student Agencies selling advertising for travel guides provided his "first real business experience" and taught sales skills that proved "very helpful to me when I eventually went and raised a fund coming out of business school."

### Early Career: Real Estate and Gotham Partners

After Harvard, Ackman worked in real estate finance, which provided a "mental model for thinking about the value of something." He notes that "real estate people don't care about accounting. They care about cash flow," establishing a cash-flow-focused valuation framework.

At Harvard Business School, Ackman discovered there was "literally not one class offered on how to be an investor." He opened a Fidelity account with $40,000 and began investing, treating potential losses as "equivalent of another year of school." His first stock purchase in October 1990 was profitable, focusing on banks and real estate companies during a period of distress where he had competitive advantage.

Ackman formed an investment club with classmate David Berkowitz, and they launched Gotham Partners in March 1993 with $3.1 million after Ackman successfully raised capital. The fund focused on liquid securities and value investing with catalysts.

### Activist Short Campaigns: Farmer Mac and MBIA

**Farmer Mac**: A friend recommended Farmer Mac (Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation) as a buy, but Ackman's research revealed fundamental problems. The company's debt was listed as AAA-rated, but when he called rating agencies, "they said they didn't cover the company. They weren't actually AAA rated, which was pretty stunning."

Ackman identified that farm loans were "not fungible" and the securitization model made no sense. Using the newly available credit default swap market, Gotham bought protection on Farmer Mac and published a series of white papers called "Buying the Farm" exposing the issues. This became "the first, I believe, activist short in history."

**MBIA**: Following the Farmer Mac success, a Lehman counterparty suggested examining MBIA (Municipal Bond Insurance Association). Originally guaranteeing low-risk municipal debt, MBIA had "moved out on the risk curve" dramatically. By 2002, "they had a trillion dollars of obligations and they had 5 billion of equity."

Ackman discovered MBIA was illegally writing credit derivatives through a structure they called a "transformer" to circumvent New York insurance regulations. Gotham bought "billion plus of credit default swaps on the company."

MBIA fought back aggressively, catalyzing investigations by the SEC and Attorney General Eliot Spitzer. This political and legal pressure, combined with a judge's adverse ruling on an important transaction, led to Gotham Partners' wind-down. However, Ackman maintained the MBIA position through an SPV and later through Pershing Square, eventually achieving "a big payoff" during the financial crisis.

### Formation and Evolution of Pershing Square

Ackman launched Pershing Square approximately one year after winding down Gotham Partners. Key structural decisions included:

1. **Solo Leadership**: His former partner wanted "a calmer life," and Ackman concluded that "you kind of need one person's ultimate accountable."

2. **Liquidity Focus**: Eliminated illiquid investments and side pockets, committing to "very liquid large cap stuff."

3. **Infrastructure Investment**: Committed to investing in "infrastructure systems, the non-investment part of the business."

4. **Advisory Board**: Established a board of "gray hairs" who could "push back, would help me when there were big decisions to be made."

### The Three Eras of Pershing Square

Ackman characterizes Pershing Square's history in three distinct periods:

**Era 1 (2004-2015)**: The first 11.5 years focused on finding "the best businesses in the world, durable growth companies" available at attractive prices, often during challenging times or market misunderstandings.

**Era 2 (2015-2017)**: A challenging period marked by the Valeant Pharmaceuticals investment, which "did not meet our simple, predictable model. Didn't meet our checklist." This period included significant performance challenges and investor redemptions.

**Era 3 (2018-Present)**: The permanent capital era, beginning when Ackman and partners acquired 25% of Pershing Square Holdings to ensure permanent capital structure. This era has produced "24% net, which is the best we've ever done over time."

### Transition to Permanent Capital

The transition to permanent capital was catalyzed by crisis. Investors were shorting Pershing's portfolio holdings and going long Herbalife (the one stock Pershing was short), betting on a redemption spiral. At the bottom, Pershing Square Holdings had an equity value of $3.9 billion, down 31%.

Ackman "borrowed a bunch of money" and redeemed from the hedge fund to buy enough of Pershing Square Holdings to reach 25% ownership, making it permanent capital. He reflected: "How much capital was Buffett managing when he was 50? The answer is the book value of Berkshire, which is a reasonable measure, was $400 million when he was 50 years old. So I said, okay, not inflation adjusted, but we got almost 10 times as much capital as Buffett."

The firm codified investment principles on "granite tombstones" (actually deal toys) placed throughout the office, creating a physical reminder of core principles to prevent future deviations like Valeant.

### Investment Philosophy and Focus on Durable Moats

Ackman's investment philosophy centers on identifying businesses with "durable moats"â€”sustainable competitive advantages that can withstand technological disruption and competitive pressure. He acknowledges the difficulty: "Buffett owned these businesses. They said were amazing. Newspapers, World Book Encyclopedia... Dexter Shoe, there are a lot of businesses that he owned that one of the best investors in the world thought had these durable moats. Some combination of technology or globalization disrupted them."

The firm's competitive advantage comes from activism: "We're able to buy at a time when people are very disappointed with management or the circumstance. The stock is inherently cheap, but in our hands, the day after we own our position, we can get ourselves in a position of enormous influence." This allows Pershing to capture "the control premium at a discount or the control benefit at a discount."

Key investment criteria include:

- **Revenue Quality**: Growth driven by increased volume/services rather than just price increases
- **Cost Structure**: Controllable costs that may benefit from technology
- **Capital Requirements**: Preference for businesses that don't require reinvestment of all cash flow
- **Extrinsic Factors**: Avoidance of exposure to uncontrollable factors (interest rates, commodities, regulation)
- **Management Assessment**: Track record evaluation through historical annual reports and conference call transcripts

### Capital-Light, Royalty-Collecting Business Models

Ackman expresses strong preference for what he calls "royalty collecting companies"â€”businesses with minimal capital requirements that generate recurring revenue streams. He disagrees with Buffett's preference for high-return businesses requiring continued capital reinvestment: "I think the best business in the world that earns enormous returns on capital, in order to continue to grow at a high rate, they don't need to reinvest. You can actually literally take that capital out of the business."

Examples from the portfolio:

- **Hilton**: "A royalty on people staying in hotels" through brand licensing
- **Universal Music**: "A royalty on people listening to music"
- **Uber**: "A royalty on people getting driven around"
- **Brookfield Asset Management**: "A royalty collecting company" through management fees

The exception is Netflix, which "has to invest enormous amounts of capital in developing content."

### Risk Management Through Concentration

Pershing Square manages $30 billion with only 41 employees total, including just 9 investment professionals. The concentrated portfolio approach is governed by strict risk management principles:

**Position Sizing Framework**: "We're prepared to risk something like five percentage points of capital on any one investment. So for something to become a 15% investment in the portfolio, we have to believe that the probability of a permanent loss of capital of a third of the position, five percentage points, has got to be de minimis."

**Risk Mitigation Strategies**:
1. Focus on unlevered or conservatively financed companies
2. Avoid exposure to uncontrollable extrinsic factors (rates, commodities, regulation)
3. Limit high-risk positions (like Hertz) to small percentages despite high upside potential
4. Leverage activist influence to reduce risk through board participation and strategic guidance

For Hertz, a turnaround situation with leverage, Pershing invested "a couple percentage point position" despite 7-8x upside potential because "the probability of a permanent loss of capital in that kind of situation is well above zero."

### AI's Impact on Active Investing

Ackman views AI as both opportunity and challenge, but believes Pershing's activist strategy is relatively protected. He notes that passive and index investing already dominates, with "the marginal buyer and seller today is often a quote-unquote pod shop." This creates opportunities: "Every once in a while, a really great business, the price is going to go down a lot because they disappointed for some reason. And there'll be a ton of liquidity at that time where you can buy an investment."

Regarding AI's direct impact on investing, Ackman emphasizes the human element: "There's a very significant human component. The assessment of a board, how they respond to a large owner, the negotiations that take place, the selection of who's the best person to run this company, recruiting them to do so, engaging with them and negotiating a compensation arrangement. A lot of these things are things that I think it's not going to be done by AI."

He's optimistic about AI's broader impact: "We're at a place now where you don't need to know anything about writing software, where you can write software. You're going to see an explosion of new kinds of software to solve new kinds of problems."

### Hiring and Team Culture

Pershing Square's hiring strategy is distinctive:

**Recruitment Profile**:
- No lateral hires from other hedge funds
- Preference for candidates with 2-3 years at Goldman Sachs or similar, followed by private equity experience
- Early demonstrated passion for investing (e.g., CIO Ryan Israel "was probably reading the Berkshire annual reports at 12")
- Private equity background valued for training in whole-business valuation and governance thinking

**Testing Process**: Candidates receive a stock to analyze, return in one week, and pitch to the entire team. This tests both conviction and intellectual humility.

**Cultural Requirements**: "It doesn't matter if you're 25 years old and your first day at Pershing Square, if you think I'm wrong about something, you tell me I'm wrong. One of the great ways to advance yourself in terms of perception among the team here is you find out something we're doing where we're making a mistake."

**Balance of Confidence and Humility**: "The best investments in the world are generally the ones where everyone else thinks you're wrong... But you have to have a lot of confidence that you're right when the whole world is making fun of you... At the same time, you have to be humble enough to recognize that, whoops, there's a new fact that I didn't contemplate."

### Concerns and Optimism for the Future

**Concerns**: Ackman expresses deep worry about politically motivated violence and threats to free speech, citing the assassination of Charlie Kirk and attacks on ICE employees. He emphasizes that "free speech is really important. One of the most important things we need in order to preserve our democracy."

He also criticizes self-censorship on college campuses: "There wasn't overt censorship, but there was a massive amount of self-censorship where members of the faculty, students were not comfortable sharing their views on a topic because of fear of cancellation."

**Optimism**: Ackman remains optimistic about potential peace in the Middle East following recent conflicts, noting that "the vast majority of countries in the Middle East are focused on prosperity for their people." He also expresses hope for resolution of the Ukraine war, noting that neither Russia nor Hamas achieved meaningful gains from their conflicts.

Personally, he states: "I love my job. It's one of the great jobs. And I work with a really super interesting team. We do fun stuff every day."

## Key Insights and Implications

1. **Permanent Capital as Competitive Advantage**: The transition to permanent capital structure represents perhaps the most significant strategic decision in Pershing Square's history. It eliminated the performance drag from capital inflows/outflows, removed the distraction of investor relations, and enabled contrarian positioning during market stress. The 24% net annual return since 2018 versus historical performance validates this structural choice.

2. **Activism as Valuation Arbitrage**: Ackman's framework reveals activism as a form of arbitrage between public market valuations and private equity control premiums. By acquiring positions during periods of disappointment and using activist influence to capture control benefits, Pershing effectively pays "60 cents on the dollar for something that's worth 130 cents to someone who's got control."

3. **Evolution from Complexity to Simplicity**: The arc from Gotham's diverse strategies (including illiquid investments and side pockets) to Pershing's focused approach on liquid, large-cap, capital-light businesses with durable moats represents a deliberate simplification that enables both scalability and superior returns.

4. **The Paradox of Concentration**: Pershing's concentrated portfolio approach appears risky but is actually risk-managed through rigorous business selection (avoiding extrinsic risk factors), conservative financing requirements, and strict position-sizing based on downside risk assessment. A 15% position requires near-zero probability of losing one-third of the investment.

5. **Human Element in an AI World**: While AI threatens many investment approaches, Ackman identifies a defensible moat in the human-intensive aspects of activist investing: board assessment, management recruitment, negotiation, and relationship building. This suggests a bifurcation in the investment industry between quantitative strategies (vulnerable to AI) and relationship-intensive strategies (protected).

6. **Learning from Failure**: The Valeant episode's most valuable outcome was the codification of investment principles into physical artifacts (deal toys) placed throughout the office. This represents a sophisticated approach to organizational learningâ€”making principles visible and unavoidable rather than merely documented.

7. **Capital-Light Business Models as Modern Moats**: Ackman's preference for "royalty collecting" businesses represents an evolution in moat thinking. Traditional Buffett-style moats often involved capital-intensive businesses with pricing power. Modern moats increasingly involve network effects, brand value, and platform economics with minimal capital requirements and superior scalability.

8. **The Importance of Writing**: Ackman's emphasis on writing as a test of understandingâ€”"if you put it down on a piece of paper, and there's no clarity to it, then there are gaps in your understanding"â€”provides a practical tool for investment analysis that forces rigorous thinking.

9. **Indexation Creates Opportunity**: The dominance of passive investing and short-term "pod shop" trading creates increased volatility around earnings events, generating opportunities for long-term concentrated investors to acquire positions in quality businesses during temporary dislocations.

10. **Culture as Competitive Advantage**: Pershing's culture of radical transparency and intellectual challengeâ€”where a 25-year-old analyst is expected to challenge the CEOâ€”creates an environment that surfaces mistakes quickly and prevents groupthink, a critical advantage in concentrated investing.

## Definitions and Terminology

**Activist Investing**: Strategy of acquiring significant stakes in companies and using shareholder influence to drive changes in management, strategy, governance, or capital allocation. Ackman's approach involves buying during periods of disappointment and using the threat or execution of proxy contests to gain influence.

**Capital-Light Business Model**: Business structure requiring minimal capital expenditure to grow, typically involving asset-light operations where the company doesn't own physical assets (e.g., Uber doesn't own cars, Hilton doesn't own hotels). Generates high returns on invested capital.

**Credit Default Swap (CDS)**: Financial derivative that allows an investor to "swap" or transfer credit risk. In Ackman's Farmer Mac and MBIA cases, he purchased CDS protection, effectively betting on credit deterioration while paying an annual premium.

**Durable Moat**: Sustainable competitive advantage that protects a business from competition over long time periods. Coined by Warren Buffett, the term refers to structural advantages like network effects, brand value, switching costs, or regulatory barriers that are resilient to technological disruption.

**General Obligation Debt**: Municipal bonds backed by the full faith, credit, and taxing power of the issuing municipality, considered among the safest forms of municipal debt.

**Permanent Capital**: Investment capital with no redemption rights or fixed maturity, allowing indefinite investment horizon. Contrasts with hedge fund capital subject to quarterly or annual redemption. Provides significant strategic advantages during market stress.

**Pod Shop**: Multi-manager hedge fund structure where capital is allocated to multiple independent portfolio managers ("pods") who operate with significant autonomy but face frequent performance evaluation and potential termination. Known for short-term orientation.

**Proxy Contest**: Shareholder action to gain board representation by soliciting votes from other shareholders, typically in opposition to management's slate of directors. Expensive and confrontational but effective tool for activist investors.

**Royalty Collecting Company**: Ackman's term for businesses that generate recurring revenue streams from underlying economic activity without owning the physical assets or bearing operational risk. Examples include asset managers, brand licensors, and platform businesses.

**Synthetic CDO**: Collateralized debt obligation that gains credit exposure through credit default swaps rather than owning actual debt securities. MBIA's involvement in synthetic CDOs was part of their risk expansion that Ackman identified.

**Transformer Structure**: Legal structure MBIA used to circumvent New York insurance regulations prohibiting insurers from writing derivatives. Involved guaranteeing liabilities of an LLC owned by a charity, which would then write the derivatives.
