## Executive Summary

This episode represents the inaugural installment of the "Quadrillions" series, featuring Don Wilson (founder and CEO of DRW and Cumberland) and Yuval Rooz (co-founder and CEO of Digital Asset, creators of Canton Network). The discussion centers on the convergence of traditional finance (TradFi) and cryptocurrency infrastructure, with particular emphasis on how blockchain technology can facilitate institutional adoption through privacy-preserving architecture.

**Core Thesis:** The path to bringing quadrillions of dollars on-chain requires purpose-built infrastructure that addresses institutional requirements—specifically privacy, regulatory compliance, and operational compatibility with existing financial systems. Canton Network represents a decade-long effort to create blockchain rails that enable real-world asset tokenization while maintaining the privacy standards necessary for institutional participation.

**Key Arguments:**
- Privacy is not optional but essential for institutional finance adoption of blockchain technology
- Existing public permissionless chains lack the architectural foundations necessary for regulated financial activity
- Tokenization will become "the rule, not the exception" within five years for frequently traded instruments
- The convergence of TradFi and crypto requires infrastructure that preserves existing operational workflows while introducing blockchain efficiency

**Strategic Approach:** Rather than pursuing short-term token gains, DRW and Digital Asset invested nearly a decade building private permissioned implementations before launching Canton as a public network in 2024, prioritizing institutional trust and technological maturity over rapid market capitalization.

## Detailed Analysis

### DRW's Foundation and Early Crypto Exploration

**Origins and Philosophy**

Don Wilson founded DRW in 1992 as a proprietary trading firm, initially focused on Eurodollar options in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange pits. Wilson's approach combined floor trading with self-developed risk management software and option pricing models, establishing a pattern of technological innovation that would define the firm's trajectory.

Wilson describes his characteristic forward-thinking approach: "I was convinced that if the Merc hadn't completely transitioned to an electronic market by the year 2000, that they would be out of business. And I was just so wrong. I mean, the trading floor perpetuated for many, many years after that." This tendency toward early adoption, while sometimes premature, positioned DRW to recognize blockchain's potential before most traditional financial institutions.

**Early Crypto Engagement (2012-2014)**

DRW's crypto journey began in 2012 when employees brought Bitcoin to Wilson's attention. The firm's culture of intellectual curiosity led to internal debates about Bitcoin's viability. Wilson articulates their dual thesis: "We decided that it was interesting, that there was some small chance that the world could agree that this was digital gold. But more importantly, or maybe as importantly, that if you could harness this technology to move, to transact traditional financial instruments, that that would be super interesting."

This insight led to two parallel initiatives:
1. **Cumberland (2014):** A cryptocurrency trading arm providing liquidity across multiple tokens
2. **Digital Asset Holdings (2014):** A blockchain infrastructure company founded by Yuval Rooz and Eric Saraniecki, both former DRW traders

**DRW's Current Scale**

By 2025, DRW employs over 2,000 people. Wilson characterizes the firm as "not just as a trading firm, but also as a markets innovation company," reflecting its dual focus on trading operations and infrastructure development.

### Digital Asset's Genesis and Core Thesis

**Initial Vision and Evolution**

Yuval Rooz joined DRW around 2009-2010 and became involved with DRWVC (DRW's venture capital arm), which focuses on investments in areas where DRW conducts business. Early crypto investments included a 2013-2014 company attempting to enable credit card purchases of Bitcoin—"maybe too early," as Rooz notes.

The original Digital Asset thesis centered on capital efficiency: "If you look at crypto compared to traditional markets, it's not as capital efficient. The way that you deploy capital across the different exchanges, there's no real prime brokerage. Everybody gets to see all of your activity."

**Pivot to Infrastructure (2016)**

After approximately two years of exploration, Digital Asset recognized a fundamental gap: "Through the first two years we understood that there is no real underlying infrastructure that can help facilitate that. And that's why in 2016, we wrote the white paper for Canton."

The white paper represented a shift from attempting to improve crypto market efficiency to building foundational blockchain infrastructure capable of supporting traditional financial instruments with institutional-grade privacy and compliance features.

**Philosophical Approach to Technology Adoption**

Rooz articulates a pragmatic view of technological disruption: "No different than in every other technology, any wave of new tech will always take out of business those that, first of all, resist it for the sake of resisting it. And second of all, if you're just in the business of saying, doing something is really hard, that's why I'm in existence, tech will kind of take you out."

He emphasizes that blockchain adoption won't eliminate traditional financial institutions but will force adaptation: "Those that will not take advantage of the technology, they will be taken out of business because they will not be able to be competitive."

### Privacy as a Fundamental Requirement

**The Privacy Imperative**

Both Wilson and Rooz identify privacy as the single most critical barrier to institutional blockchain adoption. Rooz states: "When you start thinking about real-world assets and how businesses conduct themselves, to us, privacy is like a must-have."

The privacy requirement operates at multiple levels:

1. **Regulatory Compliance:** "If you're regulated, you have legal requirements to protect your client information and activity."

2. **Fiduciary Duty:** "If you are a public company, you have fiduciary duties to kind of make sure you defend kind of your activities so people don't take advantage of that information."

3. **Market Impact:** Wilson explains: "Institutions that hold large positions in equities that are maybe below the reporting requirement... if they had to broadcast to the world every time, you know, if they started selling a big position in an equity, you know, that would have, that would cause a lot of market impact."

**Privacy vs. Anonymity: A Critical Distinction**

Rooz draws a crucial distinction between privacy and anonymity that underpins Canton's architectural approach:

"To me, zero knowledge is more anonymity rather than privacy. To me, privacy is saying I can still comply with all of the rules. But if you are not a party to the transaction, you don't need to know about it."

He uses cash as an analogy: "The value of cash is if I carry it in my wallet, nobody knows that it's in my wallet. If I went on the street or in a private room and gave it to Don, nobody knows that that transfer have ever taken place." However, he distinguishes this from regulated electronic money movement: "If you are a bank, you need to, in order to comply with regulation, know exactly who sent to who, under what conditions."

**Canton's Privacy Model**

Canton's approach enables selective disclosure: "If I send money to Don, only Don, myself and the issuer of the money need to know about that transaction. And if the issuer needs to comply with regulation, meaning I sent Don over $10,000, they can still do that because they get to know about that transaction. But Jason, you are not necessarily part of that transaction, so you wouldn't ever know that it's in existence."

This model contrasts with zero-knowledge approaches that Rooz views as problematic for financial services: "The inability to really see the inputs of a transaction, to me, is not a good thing in financial services... I don't want to trust an algorithm to tell me, don't worry, the inputs are fine." He references the FTX collapse as an example: "Imagine you had a black box for zero knowledge that said we can all provide collateral in there and the black box says the collateral is there it's fine... and we call that algorithm Sam Bankman Freed."

### Canton Network's Strategic Development

**The Decision to Build Custom Infrastructure**

When asked why Digital Asset built proprietary blockchain infrastructure rather than using existing chains like Ethereum, Solana, or Avalanche, Rooz identifies two fundamental incompatibilities:

1. **Privacy Architecture:** "Most publicly traded or public permissionless chains, at their core, do not have privacy as a core tenant. That you need to have that as a core of your offering in order to make institutional adoption natively on chain a viable thing."

2. **Immutability Paradox:** "One of the things that crypto likes to pitch to the world is that it's immutable... And I say it's true until the next hack happens. And then we convince a lot of validators to reverse that hack and suddenly it's not immutable."

Rooz argues that existing chains weren't designed for native real-world assets: "In most cases that you will see today, most of the assets actually exist in the TradFi world. So what you end up happening when you're trading these tokens is you're really having to take a lot of trust on intermediaries rather than the issuer directly saying that this is your native asset on chain."

**Strategic Patience: The Eight-Year Development Cycle**

Wilson addresses the question of why Canton took nearly a decade from white paper (2016) to public launch (2024):

"The goal here was to create a blockchain that would actually be used by large financial institutions. And so there are two things that you need to achieve that: one is the technology needs to have the right characteristics... The other is that you need to approach it in a very thoughtful, conservative, compliant manner."

The strategy involved launching as a private permissioned chain and waiting for institutional readiness: "We decided that we needed to launch this as a private permission chain and wait until the market was ready to, and by market, I mean, large institutions were ready to transact on public chains."

Wilson acknowledges the financial opportunity cost: "I think that we could have, we definitely could have, you know, made a lot of money, you know, selling a token in 2020. And we would have immediately lost every single institution that was doing stuff on the chain."

**Architectural Flexibility**

Rooz emphasizes the advantage of delayed public launch: "Once you launch a network, there's no going back. And it's actually really hard to change the fundamentals... The current architecture of Canton is probably like second or third generation and once you launch public chain, it's really hard to go back."

He notes the challenge facing existing chains: "I really don't envy public permissionless chains that do have a substantial amount of developers and applications really thinking of how to introduce privacy right now without a wholesale change of architecture, which in my opinion will kill the chain by itself."

The private development period allowed multiple use cases to mature independently: "We actually were able to have customers build applications in their own silos. Like I said, insurance, mortgages, commodities, sports wagering. And now if they upgrade to the current version of Canton, which they're all doing for the most part, now they can actually... all benefit from that."

**Network of Networks Architecture**

The name "Canton" reflects its fundamental design: "The idea of Canton is really a network of networks." This architecture enables interoperability between previously siloed implementations while maintaining privacy boundaries between different business domains.

### Tokenization and Market Infrastructure

**The Five-Year Tokenization Thesis**

Wilson articulates an aggressive timeline for tokenization adoption: "I think that most instruments that are frequently traded will be traded on chain within the next five years." He presented this view at the Washington Federal Reserve, indicating institutional receptiveness to the concept.

The value proposition centers on operational efficiency: "If you could move stuff, move tokenized, you know, if you can move on-chain treasuries, equities, munis, corporate bonds, instantaneously 24/7 and you can do financing transactions instantaneously versus tokenized dollars, whatever form those wind up taking. The efficiencies that that unlocks, as well as the additional resilience that that lends to traditional financial markets, is just so compelling."

**DTCC Partnership: Scale and Significance**

The partnership with DTCC (Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation) represents a critical validation of Canton's approach. Rooz corrects the characterization of DTCC's role: "They do much more than that. They also clear all the equities market. And they also are... the central security deposit for all of those assets."

The scale is substantial: "If you start thinking about the DTCC, I think if I remember correctly, it's like $80 trillion worth of assets that sits on our books right now."

Rooz explains the strategic importance: "The reason why we're very excited about what we've done with the DTCC, it actually allows you to start showing that you can use better settlement and management pipes under the hood, but also try to have not as much disruption on the front end of how those large traditional asset managers interact with these digital assets."

**Issuance Models: Tokenization vs. Native On-Chain**

Wilson acknowledges uncertainty about the ultimate issuance model: "I think that there are two ways that this can go. You can keep DTCC in the mix, and you can go through the regular issuance platform... or individual companies could issue their stock directly on chain."

He expresses concern about fragmentation: "I do worry about a lack of fungibility and a proliferation of CUSIPs if you have kind of, you know, five different flavors of the same name that aren't readily collapsible, that maybe are traded in different ways. That could be super disruptive."

### Institutional Adoption Challenges

**The Custodian Dependency Problem**

Rooz illustrates a fundamental operational challenge through a real example: A prominent asset manager was willing to invest $50 million in a fixed income issuance on Canton. When Digital Asset suggested they could use their own wallet, the response was revealing:

"What do you mean connect to the platform directly through a wallet?... We use X custodian to manage our assets... We run, manage X trillions of dollars of assets. So do you want us to have all these pipes and all of these reports and all of these audit reports and regulatory reports and all of these things that we need to do for the X trillions of dollars that we need to manage. And then we're going to have a wallet for this $50 million."

This anecdote reveals that institutional adoption requires integration with existing operational infrastructure, not replacement of it. Rooz concludes: "Yes, I am certain that new issuance will come directly into these things. But that will happen at scale... once you have proved the pipes for the big players, that they can participate without disrupting their business."

**Scale Mismatch**

Rooz highlights the scale disparity: "What is the most successful IPO recently? Circle, $30 something billion. So we're going to have the $80 trillion and then $33 billion differently. It's just not realistic."

This observation suggests that native on-chain issuance will grow alongside, rather than replace, tokenization of existing assets in the near term.

**Use Case Prioritization**

Rooz identifies trading-adjacent activities as the most accessible entry point: "I think that trading and maybe activities related to trading are just going to be much easier to onboard, mainly because a lot of those participants... the delta of convincing them to do that is much smaller."

Specific use cases include:
- Moving assets for crypto exchange trading with privacy
- Moving stablecoins with privacy
- Converting U.S. Treasuries to stablecoins to extract maximum yield
- Collateral mobility for 24/7 trading activities

However, Canton's scope extends beyond trading: "We operate in insurance, sports wagering, mortgages, commodities, and many other places where they are seeing the value."

### Future Convergence of TradFi and Crypto

**Defining True Convergence**

Rooz distinguishes between exposure to securities and actual securities: "Stocks do not trade on those platforms yet. Exposures to those stocks may be traded on those platforms, no different than you could trade exposure like leverage single name ETFs. These are not the securities."

True convergence requires legal ownership: "To me, the true convergence is when you'll actually be able to trade Apple, the actual Apple share on those platforms that you are actually, if you hold the token, you are entitled to all the rights as an investor of Apple."

He uses shareholder rights as a litmus test: "If I own one token of Berk, I do get invited to that conference because I am entitled to the same rights. I think that when that happens is when you're going to see massive influx of both institutional and retail to this space."

**Market Structure Implications**

Wilson acknowledges uncertainty about how tokenization will affect market structure: "One of the big questions is going to be, what does this do to equity market structure?" He references pending market structure legislation with DeFi carve-outs that "could be super disruptive."

The Bitcoin ETF launch provides a precedent for convergence benefits: "Obviously, the launch of the Bitcoin ETF was a huge boon to our ETF trading business. And that's something that where the ETF business was able to collaborate with the crypto team."

**Compute as the Next Commodity**

Wilson articulates a parallel thesis about compute: "Our thesis is that compute will be the largest commodity within 10 years." DRW launched two sister companies to pursue this opportunity:
1. **Compute Exchange:** Trading platform for compute
2. **Silicon Data:** Focused on compute-related data and derivative indices

Wilson sees convergence between compute and crypto: "I do think that there's just a broad convergence there and a lot of really interesting interplay that is happening and will continue to happen."

Rooz identifies AI's role in on-chain finance: "We're going to see a lot of new financial instruments being created on chain with agents behind them managing kind of like portfolio construction." He also notes AI's potential for data validation: "The value of blockchain is that it's a single source of truth. And I always say to people, well, there's risks to that. You know, if your single source of truth is not really good, you have just blindly trust that bad data is kind of the source of truth."

**Regulatory Philosophy**

Wilson opposes circuit breakers in crypto markets: "Circuit breakers in any market are a terrible idea... it just prevents price discovery. It prevents risk management." He acknowledges brief pauses (seconds) as potentially appropriate but emphasizes market-driven solutions over regulatory intervention.

On platform design, Wilson advocates for structural safeguards: "Platforms should avoid having obvious conflicts of interest... how do they make sure that customers, you know, leveraged market participants are able to effectively move collateral around when necessary? And how do they make sure that oracles are reliable, that liquidations are done in a fair manner?"

He expresses confidence in market mechanisms: "I think that the platforms that innovate the best in those areas are going to be the ones that become the most trusted and will win."

**Prediction Markets**

Wilson has long been interested in prediction markets, providing liquidity before they gained mainstream attention. He credits Polymarket with achieving product-market fit through user experience improvements. However, he notes privacy limitations: "No institution wants to... go on polymarket and make some big, you know, transparent, you know, trades about, you know, what they think."

This creates an opportunity for privacy-preserving prediction markets: "Some of these markets are going to be traded in a more institutional manner and they're still useful."

### Canton Network's Current State and Trajectory

**June 2025 Fundraise**

Canton raised $145 million in two tranches ($135 million plus $10 million), led by DRW with TradeWeb co-leading. The investor roster combines traditional finance and crypto-native participants:

**TradFi Investors:** BNP Paribas, DTCC, Goldman Sachs, Liberty, Virtu, Citadel
**Crypto-Native Investors:** Paxos, Polychain, Circle Ventures

Wilson notes that some investors (DTCC, Goldman) were already on the cap table, having built on Canton previously. Goldman had "already built their digital asset issuance platform on top of Canton."

The addition of new institutional investors like Citadel was particularly significant: "We got this mix of very important TradFi institutions along with some very important crypto native organizations. And to have that group of people come together in the same round, in the same initiative is obviously extremely rare."

**Launch Strategy and Tokenomics**

Canton launched as a public network in summer 2024 under the previous presidential administration, contrary to assumptions that the Trump election prompted the launch. Wilson emphasizes the fair launch approach: "There was no pre-mine. We launched it with zero tokens outstanding. And, you know, the validators on the network started to earn tokens."

Rooz explains the rationale for delaying exchange listings: "Launching a chain with the promise of what you will deliver in the future was not something that we were interested in doing." The team prioritized achieving "a certain amount of scale, also infrastructure support, custodians, bridges, all kinds of other decks as different types of complements to the network" before pursuing exchange listings.

**Current Metrics and Progress**

As of late 2024, Canton reports:
- Approximately 550 validators
- 20-30 applications
- Performance "five to 10x range ahead of schedule" in transactions per second and activity levels

Rooz attributes growth to tokenomics: "The tokenomics going towards those that build and participate in the network have been a huge boost for the organic growth."

**Governance and Development**

The Canton Foundation has established multiple committees with "north of 40 people every week that talk about how to make Canton better." A new committee focused on collateral management is being created, with additional use case committees planned.

**Builder Strategy**

Canton pursues both established and new builders. Rooz expresses interest in established protocols: "Existing builders like Stani have built an incredible platform with Aave and we would love for Aave to offer their services on Canton."

Simultaneously, new builders are emerging: "A lot of the new builders have been actually able to even fund some of their development by joining Canton early on and participating in the tokenomics... Multiple DEXs launched exclusively on Canton on day one."

The focus on privacy-preserving DeFi represents a differentiation opportunity: "You're gonna see some very interesting innovation there of actually being able to provide DEXs with privacy on chain."

**Strategic Focus**

Rooz articulates the ongoing priority: "Whether listing were to take place or not, pre and post listing, the focus is going to be how do we bring real world utility on chain." This includes:
- Stablecoin payments with privacy
- Collateral mobility for trading (24/7 with privacy)
- Expanding high-quality real-world assets (treasuries, equities, private equity, private credit, insurance)

The goal is to "build that crypto user experience for assets that are not just crypto native."

## Key Insights and Implications

### Strategic Insights

1. **Privacy as Architectural Requirement:** Privacy cannot be retrofitted onto existing blockchain architectures without fundamental redesign. Canton's eight-year development cycle reflects the complexity of building privacy-preserving infrastructure from first principles.

2. **Institutional Adoption Requires Operational Compatibility:** The custodian dependency problem reveals that institutional adoption requires integration with existing workflows, not replacement. Asset managers with trillions under management cannot create parallel operational infrastructure for small on-chain allocations.

3. **Scale Mismatch Drives Tokenization Strategy:** With DTCC holding $80 trillion in assets versus the largest crypto IPO at $33 billion, tokenization of existing assets will dominate over native on-chain issuance in the near term.

4. **Privacy vs. Anonymity Distinction:** Canton's model of selective disclosure (need-to-know basis) differs fundamentally from zero-knowledge anonymity, enabling regulatory compliance while preventing information leakage to non-parties.

5. **Patient Capital Advantage:** DRW's willingness to forgo 2020-2021 token sale profits in favor of institutional trust demonstrates how patient capital can pursue longer-term strategic positioning unavailable to venture-backed competitors.

### Market Structure Implications

1. **Tokenization Timeline:** Wilson's prediction that "most instruments that are frequently traded will be traded on chain within the next five years" represents an aggressive but institutionally-endorsed timeline.

2. **Convergence Uncertainty:** The ultimate relationship between tokenized traditional assets and crypto-native assets remains uncertain, with questions about fungibility, market structure regulation, and issuance models unresolved.

3. **Compute-Crypto Convergence:** The parallel development of compute as a commodity and blockchain infrastructure suggests potential integration points, particularly around AI agents managing on-chain portfolios.

4. **Market-Driven Standards:** Wilson's opposition to regulatory circuit breakers in favor of platform innovation reflects confidence that market competition will drive appropriate risk management standards.

### Technological Implications

1. **Network of Networks Architecture:** Canton's design enables interoperability between previously siloed business domains while maintaining privacy boundaries, potentially solving the fragmentation problem facing other chains.

2. **Tokenomics Innovation:** Canton's approach of directing economic incentives toward builders and validators (rather than pre-mining) has driven faster-than-expected organic growth.

3. **Privacy-Preserving DeFi:** The emergence of DEXs with native privacy on Canton represents a new category of decentralized finance infrastructure.

### Institutional Adoption Barriers

1. **Regulatory Compliance:** Privacy-preserving architecture must enable selective disclosure to regulators while preventing market-wide information leakage.

2. **Operational Integration:** Institutions require blockchain infrastructure that integrates with existing custodians, reporting systems, and audit frameworks.

3. **Trust and Maturity:** Institutional adoption requires demonstrated production reliability and ecosystem maturity before significant capital deployment.

## Definitions and Terminology

**Canton Network:** A blockchain infrastructure designed as a "network of networks" with privacy-preserving architecture for institutional finance. Built by Digital Asset, it enables selective disclosure where only transaction parties and relevant regulators can view transaction details.

**Privacy vs. Anonymity:** Privacy (Canton's model) enables selective disclosure to authorized parties while hiding information from non-parties. Anonymity (zero-knowledge model) hides information from all parties, including those who may need it for compliance or risk management.

**Tokenization:** The process of representing traditional financial assets (equities, bonds, treasuries) as blockchain-based tokens, enabling 24/7 trading and instant settlement while maintaining legal ownership rights.

**DTCC (Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation):** The central securities depository and clearinghouse for U.S. equity and debt markets, holding approximately $80 trillion in assets and processing settlement for virtually all institutional broker-to-broker transactions.

**Cumberland:** DRW's cryptocurrency trading arm, founded in 2014, providing liquidity across multiple digital tokens.

**Real-World Assets (RWA):** Traditional financial instruments (treasuries, equities, bonds, real estate, commodities) represented on blockchain infrastructure, as opposed to crypto-native assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum.

**Network of Networks:** Canton's architectural approach enabling interoperability between different business domains (insurance, mortgages, trading, etc.) while maintaining privacy boundaries between them.

**Fair Launch:** Token distribution model where no tokens are pre-mined or sold before network launch; validators earn tokens through network participation from genesis.

**Prime Brokerage:** Financial services enabling institutional investors to borrow securities and cash, consolidate custody, and manage risk across multiple trading venues—currently lacking in crypto markets.

**CUSIP:** Committee on Uniform Securities Identification Procedures number, a unique identifier for securities in North America. Wilson's concern about "proliferation of CUSIPs" refers to potential fragmentation if the same security exists in multiple non-fungible forms.
