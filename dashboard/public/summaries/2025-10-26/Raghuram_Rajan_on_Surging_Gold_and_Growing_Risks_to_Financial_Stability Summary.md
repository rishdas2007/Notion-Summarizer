## Executive Summary

This podcast episode features Raghuram Rajan, professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business and former Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, discussing current financial market conditions and systemic risks. Recorded at the Institute for International Finance annual meeting in Washington, D.C., the conversation addresses the simultaneous surge in gold prices and risky assets, the appropriateness of central bank rate cuts, and growing vulnerabilities in the financial system.

**Main Arguments:**

1. **Gold's surge reflects multiple factors**: geopolitical risk driving central bank diversification away from developed country currencies, questions about safe asset availability given fiscal deficits globally, declining interest rates reducing the opportunity cost of holding gold, and general market froth.

2. **Historical crisis patterns are reemerging**: Financial crises over the past century consistently follow a U-shaped monetary policy pattern—easy conditions building risks, followed by tightening that triggers collapse. Current conditions exhibit concerning similarities.

3. **Monetary policy may not be restrictive**: Despite Fed characterizations, financial conditions indices show accommodative conditions, credit spreads are at historic lows, and inflation remains closer to 3% than the 2% target, suggesting policy is not truly restrictive.

4. **AI investment poses malinvestment risks**: Massive infrastructure spending on AI may not generate returns quickly enough to justify investment costs, particularly if interest rates remain higher than anticipated, creating potential for significant losses.

5. **Political consensus underpins institutional strength**: Central bank independence depends fundamentally on political consensus, which is eroding in developed countries. Institutions cannot be made fully independent through structural protections alone.

6. **Leverage amplifies systemic risk**: The combination of rising asset prices and expanding credit—particularly in private credit markets—historically signals elevated crisis risk. Current conditions show both factors present.

## Detailed Analysis

### The Gold Surge: Multiple Drivers

Rajan identifies gold's price surge as beginning in 2023, driven by several interconnected factors rather than a single cause. The primary driver is geopolitical risk, specifically central banks' concerns about the "weaponization of payments" following events like the seizure of Russian assets after Ukraine's invasion. Central banks are questioning whether they want all reserves held in developed country currencies that could potentially be sequestered.

Beyond geopolitical concerns, Rajan points to a broader crisis of safe assets. He questions the safety of Japanese government bonds given "huge amount of debt, probably higher inflation than in the past, and interest rates really low." The euro area faces persistent questions about cohesion and bailout mechanisms. The United States is "running large fiscal deficits, you know, till the eye can see," raising questions about Treasury safety.

A third factor is declining interest rates, which reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding gold. Finally, Rajan acknowledges "a fair amount of froth" in markets generally, with gold prices "probably moving along with froth as everything else."

The historical relationship between gold prices and real interest rates broke down around 2022-2023, coinciding with Russia's invasion of Ukraine and subsequent asset seizures. This timing supports the geopolitical explanation as a primary driver of the divergence from traditional pricing models.

### Geopolitical Distrust and Reserve Diversification

When Rajan served as RBI Governor, concerns about reserve asset seizure "wasn't as big a concern" as it has become. The willingness to weaponize financial infrastructure extends beyond traditional sanctions targets. Rajan notes that "if Canada can turn out to be antagonistic to a close neighbor, what about a country 5,000 miles away?" This reflects a fundamental breakdown of trust in the international financial system.

Countries are building alternatives to SWIFT payment systems precisely because "SWIFT can be weaponized." This isn't limited to "traditional sort of, quote unquote, rogue countries" but includes any nation fearing political change that could result in financial isolation.

However, Rajan emphasizes the "Tina factor"—there is no alternative. The U.S. market remains "the deepest market in the world, treasury markets and so on. It is liquid." The fact that Russian reserve seizure required deliberation and legal justification actually provides some reassurance that such actions don't happen "on a whim."

Regarding BRICS as a dollar alternative, Rajan is dismissive. While Jim O'Neill originally conceived BRICS as fast-growing economies, the grouping lacks cohesion. China and India have "fought a border conflict in 2020," and expansion to include countries like Iran makes it "much less cohesive and seems much more like a anti-West kind of structure." The prospect of a common BRICS currency is unrealistic: "forget about it. That's not going to happen."

### The U-Shape Pattern of Financial Crises

Rajan presents a historical pattern that he considers highly significant: "Look at every financial crisis in the last hundred years... If you look at the monetary policy settings before those crises, they always have a U-shape. Easy times, that's when the risks build up. Tightening, that's when it starts crumbling and it falls apart."

This pattern holds "whether that U-shape is policy rates or whether it's some kind of deviation from neutral." The accommodative phase is when vulnerabilities accumulate, and tightening triggers the collapse. Critically, "the more the credit in the easy phase, the worse it is."

The pattern was evident before the 2008 global financial crisis, including in Europe where peripheral countries with higher inflation experienced "monetary policy setting was too loose for them" while core countries like Germany and France "didn't have the kind of financial crisis, except through their lending to the periphery countries."

Applying this framework to current conditions, Rajan notes that the recent tightening cycle didn't produce the expected stress because "we had a tightening after an enormous amount of spending by governments, which essentially took the debt up from the private sector." Programs like the Paycheck Protection Program meant that "banks got bailed out" and "balance sheets weren't really adversely affected."

However, the tightening phase did produce Silicon Valley Bank, which Rajan emphasizes was "the largest crisis in terms of nominal losses in the U.S. Banking system." The crisis involved "22 bank runs at the same time" and required "enormous intervention by the Fed to support the banking system."

### Current Monetary Policy Stance and Financial Froth

Rajan challenges the characterization of monetary policy as "restrictive." While the Fed uses this term relative to an unknown $r^*$ (equilibrium rate), Rajan argues that with "strong demand and somewhat more constrained supply, R star is higher than it was historically."

More tellingly, the Chicago Financial Conditions Index has been "coming down, becoming more supportive rather than less" almost from when the Fed began raising rates. While mortgage markets are tight and "household borrowing against houses is dead in the water," elsewhere "credit spreads... are really at historic lows."

This creates what Rajan calls "a funny financial market, which is actually quite frothy in many places." His concern is that "central banks sort of seem to say somebody else is going to take care of financial stability. We're about inflation versus growth." Yet the U-shape pattern suggests "we should be paying more attention because this is the time the kind of vulnerabilities get created in the frenzy."

Specific vulnerabilities include "AI investment moving from being financed internally to being financed by credit" and "weak credit standards that are building first brands is an example." Rajan emphasizes: "Froth is when the problems are built, and we should keep that in mind."

Regarding inflation, Rajan notes it has "plateaued at three. It's still nowhere near two." Demand remains strong from "resilient households," "the AI boom," and "government spending," while supply is "more constrained because of the immigration constraint that is being put." This combination—"strong demand, weaker supply"—raises questions about whether conditions are "really conducive to disinflation."

### AI Investment Boom and Malinvestment Risks

Rajan frames the AI investment boom through the lens of Austrian economics and the concept of "malinvestment." Drawing parallels to "telecom investment during the dot-com boom," he acknowledges that "some of this infrastructure will be used" and AI will "eventually... improve productivity."

The critical issue is timing: "that transition from when the infrastructure is created to when people use it and pay for it." AI investments are "large, which have high depreciation rates at this point. And so they need the revenues in order to make them justify the investment costs."

While sophisticated organizations like Goldman Sachs can deploy AI effectively with "really smart programmers and people capable of doing that," Rajan questions whether "the average company on the street" has the capability for widespread adoption. "The pace is really important. And the Austrians always talked about the fact that the pace is critical."

If revenue realization takes longer than anticipated, "at some point the markets realize that the net present value of these investments are not that high, especially if you add in that little piece about interest rates being higher than being lower, R star being higher, long rates therefore being higher."

Rajan suggests central banks should respond by cautioning and directing supervisors to "look for this kind of lending, make sure that it is reasonable." The credit expansion should factor into rate decisions: "that's part of my calculation as to whether we're really in a boom time and whether I need to cut rates further."

### Political Threats to Central Bank Independence

Rajan challenges the conventional wisdom that institutional structures alone can protect central bank independence. The traditional development economics view held that "what distinguished developed countries from emerging markets and developing countries was always, it's the institutions," leading to prescriptions to "build the institutions."

However, Rajan argues this approach "didn't work" because "what worked was getting the politics right. Consensus amongst the parties in a country that this was the way to develop." He cites Brazil as an example where "Cardozo is the guy who brought in inflation targeting, but it was Lula who appointed governors who would continue that rather than reversing it." This "right-left combination, which built into the consensus, gave Brazil a strong institution."

The implication is stark: "our confidence in industrial country institutions should be directly proportional to our confidence in the politics being consensual." That consensus has broken down as "parties of the extreme left and the extreme right are looking more appealing than parties at the center because they offer unorthodox solutions."

Structural protections have limits: "When the central bank is assaulted at every corner by the administration, there is no set of structures which can protect it. And almost surely it will bend." Even protecting the central bank governor's tenure "is not going to help if you can affect its finances, you can affect who's appointed next."

Ultimately, "it comes down to the integrity and the backbone of the people there." Rajan praises Chair Powell for having "the integrity, had the backbone, has ignored all the slights and the arrows that have come his way. But there's only so much he can do."

Central banks face a political dilemma: "What would be harmful for the Fed is if it becomes obvious that the Fed sort of created a recession. They're being set up, in a sense, to be the four guys if there is a recession." This creates pressure to cut rates even when "inflation is still a much bigger issue."

### India's Economic Trajectory

Rajan provides a nuanced assessment of India's potential as a manufacturing alternative to China. On the positive side, India has made substantial infrastructure improvements over the past decade, with airports "as good as the best in the world" and improvements in railways and freight. "Green power is a big, big growth area" addressing power grid concerns.

Manufacturing is growing, particularly in southern and western states. Tamil Nadu, which Rajan advises, is attracting "a lot of Asian manufacturing," including Foxconn and Crocs, drawn by "Indian women. Disciplined workforce, educated."

However, significant challenges remain: "India still has issues with bureaucracy. It has issues with taxation. We need to make the taxation much more predictable." High-quality workers are concentrated in the south and west, "not so available in other parts of the country."

Rajan questions whether there's room for India as a manufacturing powerhouse alongside China: "is there a place for a 1.4 billion country, even as China stays in manufacturing with a 1.4 billion population? Probably not."

Instead, India's comparative advantage lies in services. "India now accounts for about 4.5% of service exports in the world. And that's growing really fast. Indian service exports are on par with Indian manufacturing exports."

The labor arbitrage has shifted: "where's the labor arbitrage today? It's not in your low-skilled worker. It's in your high-skilled worker. An Indian MBA costs you $50,000 from the best schools in India. A U.S. MBA, whom I teach, costs you about five times that amount." The pandemic enabled remote service delivery, which is "why services are exploding."

### Leverage and Systemic Risk

Rajan emphasizes that "it's leverage which kills, because leverage then transmits through the system." The dot-com bust wasn't catastrophic precisely because leverage was limited. This gave Alan Greenspan confidence in 2004 to argue that "we can't predict bubbles... but we can pick up the pieces when it bursts."

Current candidates for leveraged vulnerabilities include "a huge increase in private credit" and "a huge increase in low quality bonds without the bond covenants." The critical question is "who holds them. Are these entities that have runnable claims? Are these entities that a lot of other borrowers depend on so that when they shut down, somebody gets cut out of market?"

The 2007-2008 crisis saw problems build during 2005-2007, when "the Fed policy was too easy" according to the Taylor rule. "The problems emerge in the time of too easy money before it collapses. So, we are in that period when things look really good, the future looks infinitely rosy."

Banks have exposure through lending to private credit entities. "The IMF came out with some statements yesterday that a whole bunch of banks, their tier one capital would be wiped out if there was serious defaults in the private credit industry."

Rajan references "a famous paper in 2002 by Claudia Borio and Philip Lowe... which basically says the combination to worry about is an increase in asset prices and an increase in credit. When you see both run for the hills. So we're seeing that emerging."

His final assessment combines multiple risk factors: "it's a combination of the untested private credit and the fact that we have huge hopes built into the future and are investing accordingly. It's that combination, credit plus asset prices, we've seemed to project a glorious future, which I worry about."

## Key Insights and Implications

1. **The weaponization of finance has fundamentally altered reserve management**: The seizure of Russian assets represents a watershed moment that has permanently changed how central banks view reserve safety, even for countries not traditionally considered at risk of sanctions.

2. **Financial conditions indices may be more revealing than policy rates**: The divergence between the Fed's characterization of policy as "restrictive" and the actual loosening shown by financial conditions indices suggests markets are not responding to policy as intended.

3. **The U-shape crisis pattern provides a predictive framework**: Rajan's historical analysis offers a concrete warning signal—extended easy monetary policy followed by tightening consistently precedes financial crises, and current conditions fit this pattern.

4. **Political consensus is the true foundation of institutional independence**: The focus on institutional design in development economics may have been misplaced; political agreement across the spectrum is the necessary precondition for effective institutions.

5. **The AI investment boom may be creating the next crisis**: The combination of massive capital expenditure, uncertain revenue timelines, and potentially higher-than-expected interest rates creates conditions for significant losses, particularly if financed through credit.

6. **Private credit represents concentrated systemic risk**: The growth of private credit, combined with its connections to the banking system and lack of transparency, creates potential for contagion that could wipe out bank capital.

7. **India's future lies in services, not manufacturing**: Despite efforts to attract manufacturing, India's comparative advantage in high-skilled services represents a more sustainable growth path, particularly given the labor cost arbitrage in educated workers.

8. **Central banks face an impossible political trilemma**: They must maintain credibility on inflation, avoid being blamed for recession, and preserve institutional independence—but political polarization makes satisfying all three objectives increasingly difficult.
