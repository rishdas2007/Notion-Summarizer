## Executive Summary

This episode of Bloomberg's Odd Lots features Tarek Mansour, co-founder and CEO of Kalshi, discussing the emergence of prediction markets as a mainstream financial instrument after decades of regulatory constraints. Recorded live in Chicago on October 1, 2025, the conversation explores why prediction markets are experiencing unprecedented growth and how Kalshi navigated complex regulatory challenges to become a CFTC-regulated exchange.

**Core Thesis**: Prediction markets represent a fundamental expansion of financial markets that should allow trading on any future event with differing opinions. Kalshi's success stems from prioritizing regulatory legitimacy over offshore or on-chain alternatives, spending 3.5 years obtaining licenses and an additional 2 years fighting for election market approval through litigation.

**Key Arguments**:
- Regulatory legality was the primary historical barrier to prediction market adoption, not technological or market limitations
- A market-based model (peer-to-peer exchange) is structurally superior to traditional sportsbook models where odds are set by the house
- Sports betting currently dominates volume (approximately 90% on NFL Sundays vs. regular weekdays), but other categories are growing from lower baselines
- Institutional adoption requires significantly higher liquidity thresholds ($50-100 million minimum) than currently available, representing a 2-3 year development horizon
- The distinction between "trading" and "gambling" centers on whether risks are natural (Brexit, elections) versus artificial (dice rolls), and whether the platform profits from customer losses or transaction fees

**Outcome**: Kalshi has grown approximately 3x larger than competitor Polymarket within one year of winning its election market lawsuit, operates with CFTC regulation across exchange, clearinghouse, and broker licenses, and is expanding into company-related prediction markets as the next regulatory frontier.

## Detailed Analysis

### The Regulatory Journey: From Illegal to Mainstream

Mansour identifies regulatory prohibition as the "elephant in the room" explaining why prediction markets failed to achieve mainstream adoption despite decades of interest. He references Intrade, an offshore prediction market founded by John Delaney that operated from Dublin using a "VPN type setup." The CFTC shut down Intrade in 2012, and two weeks later, Delaney died climbing Mount Everest—an event Mansour notes generated controversy about potential causation.

This history informed Kalshi's foundational strategy: **"the only way for this to go big is we got to legalize it."** Mansour emphasizes that no amount of scale or cultural adoption would protect an unregulated platform from government shutdown. This led to an initial 3.5-year period focused exclusively on regulatory work to obtain CFTC approval.

The regulatory battle intensified around election markets. Kalshi spent two years fighting the prior administration's opposition to election market approval, ultimately suing their own regulator. Mansour characterizes this lawsuit as "the turning point" for prediction markets, stating: **"this is when we want that, the institution, like this is when everything changed."**

When asked if Kalshi would have "died" without Trump's November 2024 victory, Mansour responds: "No, it would have just been slower and harder. But no, not died. I mean, we didn't die under the harshest environment of all, I think." He describes the prior administration as "as hostile as it gets" toward prediction markets.

### Kalshi's Legal and Operational Strategy

Kalshi obtained three separate CFTC licenses: the exchange license (2020), clearinghouse license (2024), and broker license (2025). Mansour disputes characterizations that Kalshi is merely "not CFTC banned," asserting these represent formal approvals, not passive non-disapproval.

However, individual contracts operate under a "self-certification" regime—the same framework CME uses. Markets are filed with the CFTC, which has authority to block them. Mansour explains that historically, filing without prior engagement typically resulted in the CFTC calling to halt the process. Early market listings took 18 months; Kalshi now lists markets within 30 minutes due to established operational frameworks and regulatory relationships.

The legal basis for sports markets rests on federal preemption. Under the Commodities Exchange Act, there is a two-pronged test: events must relate to "war, terrorism, assassination, violence, or gaming" and involve activities illegal under state or federal law. Even if sports markets fall under "gaming," the CFTC must make an explicit determination that they are "contrary to public interest."

Mansour argues the CFTC is "not asleep at the wheel" regarding sports markets: **"We talked about it. It's not like we showed up one day and like, hey, surprise, sports markets are here."** He acknowledges the administration change was relevant but maintains the legal foundation is solid.

### Business Model: Trading vs. Gambling

Mansour draws a sharp distinction between "gambling" and "trading," while being less concerned about the term "betting." He references the 1905 Supreme Court case *Chicago Board of Trade v. Christie*, where the Court ruled in favor of grain futures as financial instruments rather than gambling under bucket shop laws, recognizing value beyond speculative activity.

**Core distinction**: Gambling involves creating artificial risk (rolling dice), while trading involves natural risks that exist independently (Brexit outcomes, election results). More importantly, gambling establishments structure odds against customers and may ban winning players. Mansour states: **"the revenue of the company is equal to the losses of its customer and vice versa. I just don't think this is the same here."**

Kalshi generates revenue through transaction fees, similar to the New York Stock Exchange or Robinhood, not from customer losses. The platform reports that the percentage of users who lose approaches 50-50, contrasting with traditional sportsbooks where structural disadvantages are built into odds.

Mansour acknowledges that most activity in commodity futures markets (95%+) is speculative rather than hedging, including grain futures. He argues that attempting to separate speculation from hedging would eliminate liquidity entirely and make markets non-functional. The standard cannot be that all activity must be hedging, as this would require canceling the Commodity Exchange Act entirely.

On zero-day-to-expiration (0DTE) options, which involve approximately $1 trillion in retail volume, Mansour questions: **"What is retail doing there? Like hedging? I mean... What exactly are they doing?"** He positions Kalshi's markets as no different from accepted speculative financial instruments.

### Market Structure and Liquidity Mechanisms

Kalshi operates as a peer-to-peer exchange where users can be price makers, not just price takers. Market makers play a crucial role in bootstrapping liquidity for new markets. Mansour explains: **"if you list a new market right now... you got to kickstart somehow, right? Like the financial markets need market makers."**

Market maker obligations are structured through incentive programs. For example, on the Federal Reserve rate market, a market maker might commit to posting 75,000 contracts on each side within a 3-4 cent spread with 98% availability. In exchange, they receive fee rebates. These programs are publicly available, and participants can select which markets to support (economics, politics, sports, or combinations).

Mansour emphasizes that market maker participation decreases as markets mature: **"the more successful a market becomes, the more profitable a market becomes, the lower the percentage of market makers... and the higher it is, it's basically organic liquidity."** The most liquid markets are predominantly driven by organic peer-to-peer trading rather than institutional market makers.

Kalshi Trading (KT), the company's proprietary trading arm, operates with complete informational separation. Mansour states it is "fully siloed informationally" and receives no privileges beyond what's available to other market makers. Small teams of 2-3 people participating in market maker programs sometimes outperform institutional participants, including Kalshi's own trading operation.

Partnerships include Susquehanna (SIG) and other institutional market makers. Mansour notes a long-standing relationship with SIG, including founder Jeff Yass, who "really believes in the vision" of having "skin in the game to forecast any question about the future."

### Sports Markets and Growth Dynamics

Sports markets currently dominate Kalshi's volume, particularly on NFL Sundays, which represent approximately 90% of sports activity. The gap between Sunday volume and regular weekday volume is roughly 3x. However, Mansour notes: **"if you compare like a one-to like a game to like, basically anything that Trump does, Trump will win."** The challenge is that political events lack the scheduled regularity of sports.

Mansour expresses surprise at the scale of sports growth: **"every week, we do a forecast and we beat it... America likes NFL. I mean, I don't know. I mean, they like football."** Beyond sports, culture-related markets are "growing at a similar rate" but from a much lower baseline with less developed liquidity.

The company's marketing has been aggressive. A Facebook ad stating "breaking news, sports betting in California is now legal" generated controversy. Mansour acknowledges the ad is no longer running and attributes it to rapid scaling: **"You've got to imagine a company that grew 100x overnight."** He defends the accuracy, noting it is legal to trade on Kalshi in the United States, including California, under federal preemption.

Kalshi intentionally did not charge fees on election markets, viewing the priority as demonstrating that "these markets work and it's done safely and nothing bad is going to happen and democracy is going to be totally fine."

### Institutional Adoption and Future Markets

Current institutional use is limited by liquidity constraints. Small proprietary trading shops can access millions in liquidity, but top-tier hedge funds require minimum sizes of $50-100 million to justify allocating desk resources. Mansour estimates: **"I don't think liquidity is there quite yet. Like elections started flirting with that sort of level."**

The institutional adoption timeline is projected at 2-3 years. As price benchmarks become established across more event types, creating liquidity becomes easier—analogous to how options markets benefit from underlying price discovery. Mansour envisions institutional risk transfer as the use case where "the TAM really expands launcher."

Conversations with institutional players focus on learning requirements rather than sales pitches: **"our approach is much more like, we learn, we learn, and then we figure out how to build the right product and then people come."** Institutions express interest in hedging specific events (NFP prints, CEO departures) or external factors that could disrupt investment theses.

Current barriers include compliance and regulatory requirements (largely solved), liquidity depth, and margin requirements. Kalshi currently requires full cash collateralization—trading $100 requires posting $100. This is "very difficult" for large institutional players. Prime brokerage integration is critical because it enables portfolio margining benefits and serves as the typical gateway to financial markets.

Broker partnerships are expanding. Robinhood and Webull already integrate Kalshi markets, with Robinhood's App Store presence prominently featuring football imagery. Mansour notes the cultural shift: **"it's pretty crazy if you go to the app store and you just like look at robin hood it's the first thing is like the football."**

### On-Chain Strategy and Technological Vision

Mansour distinguishes between on-chain technology and regulatory avoidance. He notes that Polymarket is "pivoting to ours basically"—moving toward regulated structures rather than remaining purely decentralized. Kalshi explored on-chain options in its first two weeks but concluded that Augur's on-chain approach also faced regulatory shutdown.

However, Mansour sees substantial benefits to blockchain technology beyond regulatory arbitrage:

1. **Liquidity access**: "there's a lot of liquidity on chain today so that's something that we should access at some point"
2. **Clearing efficiency**: On-chain infrastructure is designed for novation and immutability, currently handled through operational and legal processes
3. **Transparency**: Trades and transactions become publicly visible, enabling permissionless development of UIs and analytical tools

Mansour's mental model compares traditional banking rails to blockchain: **"the banking rails were set up in the kind of early 20th century it's like jp morgan a bunch of his friends are like hey how do we dominate this whole thing and you know they set up a bunch of regs and then they close the door behind them."** He views on-chain development as giving "smart, hardworking developers" the freedom to rebuild financial infrastructure without legacy constraints.

He agrees with the assessment that "over the next four or five years" significant financial activity will move on-chain, noting that "companies like Robinhood, like companies, like a lot of companies are leaning in. Well, Calcio is also leaning in."

### Vision for Market Expansion

Mansour articulates a general principle: **"anything that has a difference of opinion, difference of opinion, qualitative opinion should basically have a mechanism to resolve that quantitatively."** This means converting subjective debates into objective, quantitative trading.

The company name "Kalshi" means "everything" in Arabic, reflecting the long-term vision. Mansour envisions perpetual futures for every stock, private companies (SpaceX futures), and company-related events. The next regulatory frontier is SEC-related markets for company-specific events.

The historical bottleneck has been CFTC-SEC jurisdictional overlap. Securities fall under SEC regulation, futures under CFTC regulation. Operating under both regulators "doesn't scale linearly. It scales sort of quadratically." Mansour suggests the current regulatory environment may enable progress: **"maybe now in this environment, I think it might be possible. And maybe we'll figure it out on Monday."**

Mansour acknowledges limits: **"there are markets that do create bad incentives. And I think actually the CA does handle them."** Kalshi has avoided these markets, though he doesn't specify which categories create problematic incentives.

On the philosophical question of whether regulators should restrict individual financial choices, Mansour takes a strong free-market position: **"I'm a strong believer that the job of regulators should not be dictating what people should do with their money or their lives."** He advocates for "fair rules of the road" and customer protection but opposes paternalistic restrictions on what financial instruments people can access.

## Key Insights and Implications

1. **Regulatory strategy as competitive moat**: Kalshi's multi-year investment in regulatory approval created a defensible position that offshore or on-chain competitors cannot easily replicate. The willingness to sue their own regulator demonstrated commitment that ultimately shifted the institutional landscape.

2. **Liquidity bootstrapping paradox**: New markets require market makers to provide initial liquidity, but successful markets become predominantly peer-to-peer. This creates a dynamic where institutional market maker participation inversely correlates with market success and profitability.

3. **Sports as gateway, not destination**: While sports currently dominate volume, individual Trump-related events generate higher per-event volume than individual games. The scheduled regularity of sports provides consistent activity, but political and cultural events may represent higher ceiling opportunities.

4. **Institutional adoption threshold**: The $50-100 million minimum liquidity requirement for top-tier institutional participation represents a clear milestone. Until markets consistently support this depth, institutional hedging use cases remain theoretical rather than practical.

5. **Regulatory arbitrage vs. technological innovation**: The distinction between using blockchain to avoid regulation versus leveraging its technical benefits (transparency, clearing efficiency, permissionless development) will likely define the next phase of prediction market evolution.

6. **Market-based price discovery vs. house odds**: The structural difference between peer-to-peer exchanges (where the platform profits from fees) and traditional bookmakers (where the house profits from customer losses) may prove more significant than the trading vs. gambling semantic debate.

7. **Federal preemption strategy**: Kalshi's sports market legality rests on federal commodities law superseding state gambling regulations—a legal structure that could face challenges from state regulators or require explicit CFTC determinations of public interest.

8. **Rapid scaling challenges**: Growing "100x overnight" after winning the election lawsuit created operational pressures that manifested in marketing missteps and infrastructure strain. The company's ability to maintain regulatory compliance while scaling at this pace will be tested.

## Data and Figures

## Definitions and Terminology

**Prediction Markets / Event Markets**: Financial markets that allow trading on the outcomes of future events, producing probability-weighted forecasts through price discovery.

**Self-Certification Regime**: A regulatory framework where exchanges file new contracts with the CFTC, which has authority to disapprove but does not provide explicit approval for each contract. CME operates under the same regime.

**Federal Preemption**: Legal doctrine where federal law supersedes state law. Kalshi argues CFTC regulation of commodity markets preempts state gambling laws.

**Market Maker**: An entity that commits to providing liquidity by posting bid and ask prices, facilitating trading even when organic peer-to-peer liquidity is insufficient.

**Novation**: The process of substituting a new contract or party for an existing one in financial clearing, ensuring counterparty obligations are met.

**Prime Broker**: A financial institution providing comprehensive services to hedge funds and institutional investors, including custody, clearing, margin lending, and consolidated portfolio management.

**Bucket Shop Laws**: Historical regulations prohibiting establishments that allowed speculation on price movements without actual commodity delivery, often associated with gambling.

**Zero-Day-to-Expiration (0DTE) Options**: Options contracts that expire on the same day they are traded, representing highly speculative short-term positions.

**Wash Trading**: Artificial trading volume created by simultaneously buying and selling to create the appearance of market activity without genuine risk transfer.

**On-Chain**: Transactions and operations recorded on a blockchain, providing transparency, immutability, and potential for permissionless development.
